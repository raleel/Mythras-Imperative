# Mythras Imperative System Resource Document

# Introduction

_Mythras Imperative_ is an Open, ORC Licensed, version of the _**Mythras**_ ruleset. This document offers a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, set of rules, including character creation, skills, rules for certain typical situations, combat, and magic – more than enough to get both players and Games Masters started, and form a solid basis for further development. _Mythras Imperative_ is compatible with the Mythras core rules, and other ORC licensed percentile gaming systems. Its companion volume, _Classic Fantasy Imperative,_ is also completely compatible and released under ORC, meaning that the two Imperatives can be easily combined.

## New to d100?

_Mythras Imperative_ is a d100 or percentile system. Percentile dice, or 1d100, are used to resolve key actions – skill use, combat, magic casting, and so on. It is a roll-under system, meaning that the target number is expressed as a percentage (Athletics 65%, for instance), and both the Games Master and player are looking to roll equal to or less than this target number, using 1d100, to achieve a Success. It is quite easy to replace the 1d100 with a d20 if preferred, and all percentages can be divided by 5 (round up) to gain the target number for a d20 roll. Athletics 65% would become Athletics 13, in our example.

However, 1d100 offers a great deal of flexibility and nuance that underpins the whole game, so our recommendation is to try the 1d100 approach first. While it may seem counterintuitive to have to roll _less_ than something (in many games, higher is usually better!), having a target number expressed as a percentage range that one needs to roll within makes it easy and simple to see your chances of success, and allows for quite a few 'dice tricks,' such as Opposed Rolls, Criticals and Fumbles, and a few other things explored later in these rules. Percentile roleplaying has been around since the earliest days of roleplaying, androleplaying and is a firmly established game system with a tried and tested core mechanic that is flexible, intuitive, and tends to fade into the background during play.

## Simplification

Long time owners of _**Mythras**_ will note that in some places the _Mythras Imperative_ rules have been simplified. This has been done so that a Games Master may more quickly introduce the game to new players with a minimum of fuss.

## Rounding of Numbers and Results

On some occasions you will be required to divide numbers – typically the rating in a skill (such as for determining a Critical Success, which is 1/10th of the skill's value). Whenever a division result creates a fraction, always round up to the whole number. So, for instance, 1/10th of 63% is 6.3; this is rounded up to 7.

## Dice Used

_Mythras Imperative_ uses the standard polyhedral dice set: d4, d6, d8, d10 d12, d20 and d100. Additionally, the following dice are called for:

d2: Roll any die. An odds number equals 1 and evens equals 2. Or flip a coin.

d3: Roll a six-sided die; 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, 5-6 = 3

# Characters

Every player in _Mythras Imperative_ controls a character. A character is the player's alter-ego, and is usually very different, physically, and mentally, to the player. Characters can be from a variety of races, according to the setting for the game; a historical setting would feature just humans, whereas a fantasy setting could involve dwarves, elves and even lizardmen. The basic character is defined by a series of different elements that describe the character's capabilities. These elements are:

- Characteristics: such as Strength or Charisma

- Attributes: things like Height or Movement

- Skills: expertise in fundamental abilities

Most of these elements are described in terms of numbers, and some are dependent on or calculated by others. What each element means, and how they are determined, is described in the following sections.

## Step 1: Character Concept

A good place to start is to have some idea of what sort of character you want to play: a cunning warrior perhaps, or a wily smuggler. Maybe you prefer a studious academic, or a sagacious magician. Your character concept does not need to be elaborate at this stage; simply an idea that will help guide certain choices such as Culture and Career.

## Step 2: Characteristics

Everyone is defined by seven Characteristics which tell you something about your character; how strong or fast they are; how clever or healthy. Characteristics are at the core of every _Mythras Imperative_ character and form the basis for most of the other elements such as Attributes and Skills. The seven Characteristics are:

- Strength (STR)
- Constitution (CON)
- Size (SIZ)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Power (POW)
- Charisma (CHA)

Before calculating the Characteristics, the following section explains what each represents.

### Strength (STR)

STR represents physical strength: how much one can lift, how hard one can hit, and so on. STR is a component of the Damage Modifier. If a character is reduced to zero STR they lack the ability to move or lift objects.

### Constitution (CON)

CON is measure of health and hardiness. CON is a component in determining Hit Points and Healing Rate. If CON falls to zero for any reason the character dies.

### Size (SIZ)

SIZ measures mass, and helps indicate Height and Weight. SIZ is used to help figure Hit Points, as larger, heavier creatures tend to have greater endurance against damage. SIZ can also be used to determine a character's Damage Modifier, since mass helps to increase the force of a blow.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Agility, balance, and reflexes are measured by DEX. It is an important aspect of Action Points and Initiative. If a character is reduced to zero DEX, they suffer functional paralysis.

### Intelligence (INT)

INT is measurement of cognitive ability. Those with a lower INT score are not necessarily stupid, but they are likely to be constrained in how creatively they can employ their wits. INT is a factor in calculating Action Points and Initiative. If INT is reduced to zero, the character becomes completely mindless.

### Power (POW)

POW is a measurement of a character's soul, spirit, inner drive, or capacity for magic. POW governs a character's Magic Points and Luck Points. If a character's POW ever drops to zero, they lose all independent will.

### Charisma (CHA)

Charisma is a measure of presence and personality, andpersonality and is independent of physical appearance. CHA affects a character's Experience Modifier. If CHA ever falls to zero, the character can no longer socially interact with others, becoming so painfully shy or antisocial they are ignored or even driven away.

## Calculating Characteristics

Each Characteristic has a numerical value to determine how potent it is. The number in parentheses after each dice score is the racial average and is used as a gauge to rate your character's results when compared to other members of their species. Suggestions for determining your Characteristics include:

**Dice Roll** : Roll dice for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA taking each rolled score as it comes. Since the results of these rolls can be somewhat random, it is often better to decide on a character concept after the dice are rolled. Otherwise, the final Characteristics may preclude a preconceived role. Roll 3d6 for STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA; then 2d6+6 for SIZ and INT.

**Dice Roll, Assign** : As above, except the player may exchange values between Characteristics with the same dice range. For example, when rolling up a human, the player could swap values among STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA, as they share a 3d6 range, or between SIZ and INT, which share the 2d6+6 range —but they must always be from the same dice range group; you cannot switch rolls from one group to the other.

**Dice Roll, High** : Roll one extra die as indicated for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA, and drop the lowest result from each.

**Points Build** : Players assign Characteristic scores from a pre-determined pool of 80 points. Characteristics cannot be lower than the minimum rolled value, nor higher than the maximum.

## Step 3: Attributes

Each character also has a set of attributes. These are capabilities derived from the Characteristics or determined by them that are used to govern certain factors of game play.

### Action Points

How often a character can act in a Combat Round is determined by Action Points. All _Mythras Imperative_ characters have 2 Action Points.

### Damage Modifier

Larger and stronger characters and creatures may gain additional damage in certain situations; conversely, weaker, and smaller characters may reduce the damage they can inflict. The Damage Modifier is generally used in combat situations but can also be used when attempting to break objects. The Damage Modifier is an extra die roll which is either added to, or subtracted from, the damage inflicted by the weapon or tool. If a negative Damage Modifier takes a weapon's damage to zero or below, then no damage at all has been inflicted.

Add together STR and SIZ and consult the Damage Modifier table, below.

**Damage Modifier**

| STR+SIZ | Damage Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| 5 or less | –1d8 |
| 6–10 | –1d6 |
| 11–15 | –1d4 |
| 16–20 | –1d2 |
| 21–25 | +0 |
| 26–30 | +1d2 |
| 31–35 | +1d4 |
| 36–40 | +1d6 |
| 41–45 | +1d8 |
| 46–50 | +1d10 |
| 51–60 | +1d12 |
| 61–70 | +2d6 |
| 71–80 | +1d8+1d6 |
| 81–90 | +2d8 |
| 91–100 | +1d10+1d8 |
| 101–110 | +2d10 |
| 111–120 | +2d10+1d2 |
| Each 10 points | Continue Progression |

### Experience Modifier

Over the course of play characters improve their skills and capabilities. This is achieved using Experience Rolls which are explained in more detail in the Game System section.

A character's CHA score may adjust the number of Experience Rolls the character receives, reflecting the relationship they have with their peers and their reputation in the community. With a high CHA people are willing to put themselves out to help train or support the character while they undergo tuition. Conversely, with particularly low CHA, there may be some difficulty improving one's capabilities without the assistance of others; finding someone to spar against for example.

**Experience Modifier**

| CHA | Exp. Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| 6 or less | -1 |
| 7-12 | +0 |
| 13-18 | +1 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

### Healing Rate

After receiving injuries, a character needs to recuperate. Healing Rate determines how quickly they naturally recover from wounds. Depending on the severity of the injury, the Healing Rate denotes how many Hit Points are recovered per day, week, or month.

**Healing Rate**

| CON | Healing Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 6 or less | 1 |
| 7-12 | 2 |
| 13-18 | 3 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

### Hit Points

Hit Points represent how much injury an area of the body can withstand before it becomes useless, possibly resulting in incapacitation and ultimately the character's death. The body of every creature is divided into separate locations – humans, for example, have seven: the head, chest, abdomen, arms, and legs – each location with its own Hit Points.

Some creatures, such as monsters or different classes of animal, by their very nature often have radically different body structures, yet each location they possess still has Hit Points. When a location's Hit Points are reduced to a certain level through damage of any kind, then the character suffers certain consequences that reflect the severity of the injury. For further information concerning wounds see the Damage and Wound Levels section.

To calculate the Hit Points of each location, add CON and SIZ together and cross-reference the result on the table, below.

**Hit Points per Location**

| Location | CON+SIZ |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|     | 1–5 | 6–10 | 11–15 | 16–20 | 21–25 | 26–30 | 31–35 | 36–40 | +5 |
| Head | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |
| Chest | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | +1 |
| Abdomen | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | +1 |
| Each Arm | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | +1 |
| Each Leg | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |

### Initiative

The moment at which someone reacts in combat is governed by Initiative. Initiative acts as a modifier to Initiative rolls; the higher the Initiative, the faster one responds in a combat situation, determining when you can act. Further factors – armor for example – modify it. The Combat chapter goes into more detail on how Initiative is used .

Initiative is the average of the DEX and INT Characteristics.

### Luck Points

Luck Points represent that strange force differentiating adventuring heroes from everyday folk. Call it fate, karma, or simple good fortune. Luck Points can be used to:

- Re-roll the dice, ifdice if they are unfavourableunfavorable.
- Mitigate physical damage or other unfortunate circumstancescircumstances.
- Gain an edge at a vital moment in combatcombat.

Exactly how they are used, and when, is described in the Game System section. Once a Luck Point is spent, the pool decreases; when one is out of Luck Points, no more are available – unless the Games Master makes an impromptu award – until the next game session when they replenish to their normal value.

**Luck Points**

| POW | Luck Points |
| :-: | :-: |
| 6 or less | 1 |
| 7-12 | 2 |
| 13-18 | 3 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

### Magic Points

Mystical abilities, powers and spells used in _Mythras Imperative_ usually rely on Magic Points. Since the availability of magic may be limited by a campaign setting or to specific magical professions, some characters will find this Attribute superfluous.

For those who can use such powers, a character's Magic Points are equal to their POW. These points are used to cast spells, the cost of which is dependent on the type of magic used. When a caster runs out of Magic Points, they have exhausted their ability to cast any spells until Magic Points are replenished.

### Movement Rate

Every creature has a Movement Rate – a number of metres that can be travelled during a specific period of time. Movement is not calculated from Characteristics but is a default value which differs from species to species. The base Movement Rate for humans is 6 metres.

## Step 4: Skills

Skills fall into two classes. Everyone has Standard skills – things such as sneaking around or influencing others. Professional skills, on the other hand, are those requiring specific training before they can be attempted – things such as tracking wild animals, piloting spacecraft or understanding ancient languages. Characters are given three pools of points to spend on acquiring skills; the first pool for the Culture they grew up in, the second for the Career they adopt after childhood, and the last to further round out their skill set. As a default, new characters assign 100 points to the Culture skill pool, 100 to the Career skill pool, and a further 150 Bonus points for rounding out. Each Culture and Career has a defined range of standard and professional skills to which those skill points may be assigned.

_**Combat Style**_ is listed in the Cultural descriptions that follow. Combat Styles are more fully explained in the Combat section, and have a Basic Percentage equal to STR+DEX.

**Standard Skills**

| Skill | Basic Percentage |
| :-- | :-: |
| Athletics | STR+DEX |
| Boating | STR+CON |
| Brawn | STR+SIZ |
| Conceal | DEX+POW |
| Customs | INT x2, +40\* |
| Dance | DEX+CHA |
| Deceit | INT+CHA |
| Drive | DEX+POW |
| Endurance | CON x2 |
| Evade | DEX x2 |
| First Aid | INT+DEX |
| Influence | CHA x2 |
| Insight | INT+POW |
| Locale | INT x2 |
| Native Tongue | INT+CHA, +40\* |
| Perception | INT+POW |
| Ride | DEX+POW |
| Sing | CHA+POW |
| Stealth | DEX+INT |
| Swim | STR+CON |
| Unarmed | STR+DEX |
| Willpower | POW x2 |

\* Includes a static bonus of +40% for both Customs and the character's Native Tongue (Common for humans).

## Step 5: Culture

Culture determines the kind of society in which the character was raised, and so prescribes certain outlooks and philosophies he or she might have. More practically, culture helps augment the values of the various skills that shape your character's overall capabilities. There are four basic human cultures: Barbarian, Civilised, Nomadic and Primitive. Each cultural background lists a range of Standard skills appropriate to it and invites the player to pick up to three of the presented Professional skills: in this way players from the same cultural background can ensure that their adventurers are different in the areas they have developed. Distribute 100 Culture skill points amongst the career's listed Standard skills and whichever Professional skills were selected, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. Games Masters may wish to apply a cap to how many skill points can be applied to any particular skill.

## Barbarian

Tribal in nature, barbarians tend to shun civilisation, viewing those who live in large towns and cities as weak and corrupt. Although their own settlements are also sedentary, they tend to be far smaller and closer to nature. Barbarian tribes occupy distinct territories, often half tamed wilderness, which they regard as their own for hunting, grazing, and farming purposes. Most are adept in the use of weaponry as they must overcome many dangers throughout their lives – facing creatures of the wilds, or mustering to defend their lands against rival tribes. Since they live in small communities the ties of kinship and clan are strong elements of their society.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Athletics, Brawn, Endurance, First Aid, Locale, Perception; and either Boating or Ride. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Craft (any), Healing, Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigation, Seamanship, Survival, Track.

## Civilised

The Civilised culture is epitomised by a semblance of law and order, underpinned by complex social codes, and supported by a bureaucracy. Civilised people believe themselves superior to all other cultures because their achievements tend toward permanence: sprawling cities, imposing temples, celebratory monuments, and the recording of history and events in books, tomes, and scrolls. Of course, this is a thin veneer. The most Civilised of cities can be more lawless than any Barbarian frontier settlement; and the social codes may be cruder than the hospitality rituals of nomads. But the Civilised culture prides itself on its achievements, its infrastructure, its professional artisans, and its ability to easily extend its reach to wherever it wishes to go.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Conceal, Deceit, Drive, Influence, Insight, Locale, Willpower. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Art (any), Commerce, Craft (any), Courtesy, Language (any), Lore (any), Musicianship, Streetwise.

## Nomadic

Nomadic people are constantly on the move, with no home and hearth to call their own. They may wander aimlessly about or might have several camps they move to and from throughout the year. They raise few crops and instead follow the migrations of animals or fish, perhaps even herding their own domesticated beasts. Nomads are adept at subsisting on what they can quickly and easily scavenge from their surroundings, letting nothing go to waste. The skills of the nomad culture should be tailored to their environment. Some journey vast distances on foot, others live in caravans or ride strange creatures, and some drift across the oceans on great floating rafts.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Endurance, First Aid, Locale, Perception, Stealth; and two of the following: Athletics, Boating, Swim, Drive or Ride depending on the primary mode of travel. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Craft (any), Culture (any), Language (any), Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigation, Survival, Track.

## Primitive

Of all peoples, primitives are those that live closest with the land, in tune with its hidden secrets. Living in extended family groups, primitive cultures gather around very simple dwellings that can range from caves and areas of natural shelter through to lean-tos or very basic huts. Primitives are typically hunter-gatherers with either few, or poorly developed, systems for farming and husbandry.

However, certain cultural beliefs, often based on superstitions, can be very well defined. Few primitive cultures have developed anything approaching a written language although paintings and other pictorial symbols serve as a means of communication.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Brawn, Endurance, Evade, Locale, Perception, Stealth; and one of either Athletics, Boating or Swim. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Craft (any), Healing, Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigation, Survival, Track.

## Step 6: Career

Every character starts the game having been trained in a career. The occupation chosen may not necessarily be the one the character continues to follow as the character begins adventuring life, but it is the career embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood and it further defines skill development. Each career presents a range of Standard skills appropriate to it and permits the player to pick up to three of the listed Professional skills. Distribute 100 Career Skill points amongst the career's listed Standard skills and whichever Professional skills were selected, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. As with cultures a Games Master may apply a cap to how many skill points can be applied to any particular skill.

Specific Professional skills, like Pilot, are unlikely to be found in a fantasy world. Skills are discussed more fully in the Skills chapter.

## Step 7: Bonus Skill Points

As a final step, a last pool of 150 skill points areis assigned to round out the character. These may be applied to any Standard skill, or those Professional skills gained as part of Culture or Career. Once again, a Games Master may apply a cap to how many skill points can be applied to any particular skill.

### Creating Experienced Characters

It is recommended that beginning characters start fresh, with little or no practical experience. Of course, the level of the characters will depend greatly on the setting and whether the game will be a short one-off adventure or a long-running campaign. It is also common for a player to create a more experienced character if replacing one that has died in play or when joining an existing campaign.

A table is provided, breaking experience into Age Categories. A character's experience has a direct correlation to age and skill competence; more experienced characters naturally have more life experience than their younger compatriots. However, the noted Age Bonus should be treated as approximate, as campaigns advance at different rates — some campaigns have lots of game time pass between adventures while others are one long string of unbroken adventures. When converting an existing character, simply substitute the actual age for that noted on the table.

**Experience Table**

| **Category** | **Age** | **Bonus Skill Points** | **Maximum Skill Increase** |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Young | 10+1d6 | 100 | +10 |
| Adult | 15+2d6 | 150 | +15 |
| Middle Aged | 25+3d6 | 200 | +20 |
| Senior | 40+4d6 | 250 | +25 |
| Old | 60+5d6 | 300 | +30 |

#### Experience Table Notes

- Bonus Skill Points determine how many points the character must spend on developing skills.
- Maximum Skill Increase limits how many of the Bonus Points can be applied to any one Skill.

### The Skill Pyramid

_Mythras Imperative_'s skill point allocation process derives 350 points from three sources: Culture (100), Career (100) and Bonus Skill Points (150). Allocating these points can be time consuming, and there are no doubt times where determining a character's Culture isn't so important, or the player has a particular Occupation in mind that isn't readily served by the templates in the core rules. An alternative system for apportioning skill points, for when time is pressing or when players are eager, is presented here.

Instead of allocating points from the Cultural, Career and Bonus Skill Points pools, the Skills Pyramid is used instead. This divides 350 points into five blocks of fixed points, as follows:

1 skill at 50%, 2 skills at 40%, 3 skills at 30%, 4 skills at 20%, 5 skills at 10%.

Which forms a handy pyramid. Simply cross off each value as it is allocated.

```
    50

   40 40

  30 30 30

 20 20 20 20

10 10 10 10 10
```

### A Few Simple Rules

- All points from the pyramid must be allocated.
- No skill can have more than one allocation from the pyramid.
- Customs and Native Language both gain +40, as per the core rules, and in addition to any allocations made from the pyramid.
- Passions which gain the values noted in the Passions section, and in addition to any allocations made from the pyramid.
- No skill can exceed 80% from the result of an allocation. So, if a character has STR 16 and DEX 17, for a base of 33%, the player cannot allocate the 50 point value to a Combat Style.
- Six of the values must be allocated to Professional Skills.
- Characters may still choose a Culture and Occupation, and use the skills listed in the appropriate description as a guide for their allocations, or the allocations can be completely freestyle.
- It is recommended that at least one of the values be allocated to a Combat Style, but this isn't mandatory.
- The Games Master always has the final say.

### Larger-Than-Life Heroics

_Mythras Imperative_ deals primarily with normal human beings, but occasionally a campaign requires something else, especially if it demands special heroics, or takes place in a Pulp Action setting, where heroes and villains tend to be larger than life.

Such heroes may not necessarily have superpowers per se (although if these are desired, the Magic and Powers chapter can be used), but they are a bit stronger, a bit faster, a bit more resilient and usually a lot more strong-willed. Think of a certain barbarian from Cimmeria; a special agent who is licensed to kill; a man of bronze; a caped vigilante who is also a billionaire playboy – or any number of popular heroic characters. They frequently face situations where a normal human would crumble; but as heroes, they can withstand whatever the plot throws at them, and live to engage in the next adventure (relatively) unscathed.

If you intend to introduce these character types into your games, then make sure that all players have characters at the same level. These character types are designed to chew the scenery and drive the action; mundane characters (unless they have the benefit of magic, or some other advantage) may well be left in the shade.

### Pulp Hero Characters

These are traditional Pulp Heroes. They aren't superheroes or demigods, and a well-placed shotgun blast will still end their life, but they are tougher, smarter, more able, and in general, a step or two above ordinary people. Also, their lives tend to be filled with adventure. While a Heroic character can choose to attempt to settle down and lead an uneventful life, often trouble or someone in need will find their way to the character's door.

#### Characteristics

When generating Pulp Heroic characters, use the Dice Roll Assign method in the Characters section. Roll 4d6 and discard the lowest die, five times, and then assign the results to STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA. Next, roll 3d6+6 and discard the lowest die twice and assign these numbers to SIZ and INT. If using the Points Build method, players build their character from a pre-set pool of 90 points.

#### Attributes

These are calculated as per normal, except that Pulp Heroic characters gain two Advantages chosen from the following (note that advantages cannot be stacked):

- +1 Action Point

- +1 Luck Point

- +1 Hit Point to each Hit Location

- Endurance rolls are one Grade easier

- Stealth rolls are one Grade Easier

- Willpower rolls are one Grade easier

All Pulp Heroic characters double their Healing Rate when suffering from Minor or Serious Wounds, although Major Wounds are handled at the character's standard Healing Rate.

#### Skills

Pulp Heroic characters gain an additional 50 Bonus Skill Points to allocate as needed.

### Paragon Characters

Paragon characters are epitomes of excellence. While a certain whip-wielding archaeologist and a licensed-to-kill super-spy are Pulp Heroic characters, that Cimmerian, Man of Bronze, Dark Knight Detective, and Sherlock Holmes are Paragon characters. Paragon characters aren't merely supremely competent in one area of expertise: they usually excel at several. A brilliant inventor and physicist who is also a two-fisted, crack-shot war hero, is an excellent example of a Paragon character; A billionaire playboy crime fighter who studied with the finest detective minds in the world is another. Paragon characters may well have several college degrees, independent wealth, mysterious benefactors, as well as numerous other forms of experience.

As a result, Paragon characters won't be for everyone, but if a setting needs characters who can change the destiny of the entire solar system, or take on any challenge, then a Paragon level campaign fits the bill. While both Ordinary and Heroic campaigns occasionally involve exceedingly high stakes like the fate of nations or even planets, Paragon campaigns should regularly do so.

#### Characteristics

When generating characters using the Dice Roll Assign method in the Characters section. Roll 4d6, discarding the lowest die six times, then assign the five results of your choice (typically, the highest five) to STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA. Next, roll 3d6+6, discarding the lowest die three times and assign the two results of your choice (typically, the highest two) to SIZ and INT. If using the Points Build method, players build their character from a pre-set pool of 100 points.

#### Attributes

These are calculated as per normal, except that Paragon Characters gain three Advantages chosen from the following (note that advantages cannot be stacked):

- +1 Action Point

- +2 Luck Points

- +2 Hit Points to each Hit Location

- Endurance rolls are one Grade easier

- Stealth rolls are one Grade Easier

- Willpower rolls are one Grade easier

All Paragon characters double their Healing Rate when suffering from Minor or Serious Wounds, although Major Wounds are handled at the character's standard Healing Rate.

#### Skills

Paragon Heroic characters gain an additional 100 Bonus Skill Points to allocate as needed.

## Step 8: Passions

Passions are used to assist players and Games Masters in deepening the nature of the character, introducing plot hooks based on a character's desire or prejudices, and helping the player to understand who his character is, what drives him, and so on.

A Passion can be for anything – a person, an organisation, an ideal, even an object. Passions are typically described by a verb such as: Desire, Despise, Destroy, Espouse, Fear, Flee, Foreswear, Hate, Love, Loyalty to, Protect, Repudiate, Respect, Seek, Subvert, Torment or Uphold.

Passions are measured in the same way as skills; they are rated between 1 and 100 (or higher). A Passion can be improved in the same way as a skill, or it can be increased or decreased by the referee depending on circumstances.

Beginning characters may start with up to three Passions, each based on two Characteristics, with a bonus of +40 to the first, +30 to the second and +20 to the third – the player deciding the order of importance. These can be tied to his culture, professionprofession, or personal foibles. For example, in a Sword & Sorcery campaign the character might take: Hate (Stygians), Distrust (Sorcerers), and Desire (Alcohol); whereas in a Dystopian Sci-Fi game the character might choose Loyalty (President), Destroy (Aliens), and Uphold (the Law) instead.

**Passion Table**

| **Object of Passion** | **Starting Percentage** |
| :-- | --- |
| A person, in a romantic or familial context | POW+CHA |
| An organization or group of people | POW+INT |
| A race or species | Character's POW x2 |
| A place | Character's POW+INT |
| An object or substance | Character's POW x2 |
| A personality trait | Character's POW+CHA |

### Using Passions

A Passion is any deeply held commitment that has the capacity to influence events during play. Although they can be used as stand-alone Abilities (to call them skills is to do them a disservice), Passions are further expanded below to explain in more detail how they work and how they can influence _Mythras Imperative_ characters and campaigns.

In summary, Passions can be used thus:

- To augment another skill, reflecting the depth of one's feelings and how it drives action. When used in this regard, the Passion adds 20% of its value to a skill being used, as long as the augmentation is thematically and dramatically important.

- As an Ability in its own right to drive choices, desires and emotional actions and responses. When used in this way a Standard roll is made against a Passion to determine how strongly the character thinks and feels about something. If a roll is a Success, then the character acts in line with what the Passion would dictate. If the roll Fails, then the character can act freely without feeling constrained by the Passion's drives.

- To oppose other Passions – even those held by the same character. This is typically used where two Passions would conflict. For instance, a personal love might dictate a course of action that would be contrary to an Oath or Loyalty. Here use an Opposed Roll between the two Passions, with the more successful determining how the character acts.

- As a general measure of depth of commitment, belief, and loyalty to a cause. The higher the Passion's value, the more committed the character is. Characters with similar Passions can compare their ratings to determine who exhibits the deeper commitment.

- To resist some form of psychological manipulation or magical domination. In certain cases where a character is being forced into performing an act contrary to their Passions, they may substitute either for Willpower in the Opposed Roll.

New Passions can be developed at any point during a game session if the circumstances warrant it. One might instantly develop 'Hate X' where someone else does something that would strongly invoke hatred to arise. A lord or chief calling for an Oath would immediately establish a Passion of 'Loyalty to X' as soon as that Oath is taken or sworn.

New Passions developed during play in this way cost no Experience Rolls and are established there and then. Of course, characters can also choose to establish a Passion during improvement, at the cost of an Experience Roll to gain a Passion at its Base Value.

### Deepening and Waning

Passions can increase during a game independently of Experience Rolls, based on the strength of whatever occurred to trigger the increase. Also, they can, and do, wane. A strongly held belief can be shaken by many things, leading to that Passion being either reduced or, in more extreme circumstances, reversed completely.

For instance, a character with 'Trust Chieftain' might, if his chieftain acts treacherously, either reduce his Passion or turn into 'Distrust Chieftain' at the same percentage. The Games Master needs to determine whether a Passion reduces or reverses. If it reduces, then it does so according to the strength of the source of the change.

The Deepening and Waning table shows by how much the Passion changes.

**Deepening and Waning**

| **Depth of Change** | **Passion Modified by** |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | 1d10 |
| Moderate | 1d10+5 |
| Strong | 1d10+10 |

## Step 9: Equipment

Now that the character is almost finished, he or she needs some gear. This can include weapons, armor, or other important paraphernalia used for a particular profession. In the course of adventures there are many chances to get more equipment, but each starting character has in his or her immediate possession the following:

- A set of clothing appropriate to the character's profession and the setting.

- An amount of pocket money; enough to last a little while without hardship.- A personal heirloom, keepsake, or some trinket of little relative value.

- Any trade tools or transportable equipment suitable to the character's profession, if appropriate.

- Any personal weapon for the character's Combat Style.

- Other items as appropriate for the setting, and subject to the GM's approval.

# Skills

Skills are divided into two categories: Standard and Professional. All characters have the same set of Standard Skills. Professional Skills differ between individual characters and reflect expertise developed within a career and, to a certain extent, their culture. Despite these distinctions, Standard and Professional Skills work in the same way.

## How Skills Work

A skill has a Base Value built on two Characteristics; or one Characteristic multiplied by two. There is no upper limit to a skill's value; it can exceed 100 and, in play, characters can expect to see their skills reach such heights.

Whenever a character is called upon to resolve some form of test, challenge, or professional ability, 1d100 is rolled and compared with the skill's value:

- Equal to, or less than, the skill indicates a Success

- Greater than the skill's value indicates a Failure

There are certain special cases concerning Success and Failure that should be noted.

- Any roll of 01-05 is always a Success

- Any roll of 96-00 is always a Failure, irrespective of how high the skill's value

### Criticals and Fumbles

Criticals and Fumbles represent spectacular successes and failures; those cases where a character has either excelled in his attempt or failed miserably and utterly.

- A Critical Success is equal to one-tenth of the skill's value (and this includes skills that receive a modifier – so modified skills may have a greater or lesser chance of a Critical outcome). Round fractions up when calculating a Critical Success's range. For example, if a skill is modified to twice its normal value – from 33% to 66% say, then its Critical range would be a roll of 07 or less.
- A Fumble is roll of 99 or 00. Skills with a value of more than 100% Fumble only on a roll of 00.

The precise nature of a Critical or Fumble result is left to the Games Master to determine. The consequences could be wondrous or dire, depending on the circumstances.

### Automatic Successes

There will be some occasions where a roll against a particular skill is just not necessary – either because the task at hand is easily accomplished, or because, with enough time and focus, success is guaranteed. Riding a horse at a gentle canter across an open meadow is an example of an Automatic Success where simply being skilled in the activity means that straightforward actions do not require any skill rolls to resolve them. A crafter carving a piece of wood into a chair leg is another example where a skill roll is not necessary; it takes time to accomplish, but the craftsman knows how to do the work and, if not rushing, success is assured. A rogue, undisturbed, with a set of lockpicks, can successfully pick the simple lock of a treasure chest given enough time to do so.

### Modifying Skills

There are some occasions where a skill roll is required, but the chances of success need to be adjusted to reflect existing conditions. Fleeing from bandits, for instance, might require an Athletics roll. But what if the character is fleeing through darkness or through treacherous undergrowth? In such a case the Games Master can insist on modifying the skill of the character to reflect the circumstances.

_Mythras Imperative_ uses a series of grades to determine how a skill is modified. These are as follows. Note that two types of modifiers are provided: the first is the default method, and involves a little math, but offers better simulation for scaling, especially where higher skill percentages are concerned. The Simplified Skill Modifier is a simple addition or subtraction, and easier to implement. Choose which method best fits the game but ensure that the same modification system is applied consistently.

**Difficulty Grade Table**

| Difficulty Grade | Skill Modifier | Simplified Skill Modifier |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Automatic | No need to roll | No need to roll |
| Very Easy | Double the skill value | +40% |
| Easy | Add half again to the skill value | +20% |
| Standard | No adjustment | None |
| Hard | Reduce skill value by one-third | -20% |
| Formidable | Reduce the skill value by half | -40% |
| Herculean | Reduce the skill value to one-fifth | -80% |
| Hopeless | No attempt can be made | No attempt can be made |

Where a character is already suffering a penalty from other circumstances, the hardest Difficulty Grade takes precedence.

Outside of combat, _Mythras Imperative_ does not provide a definitive list of situations and challenges which can incur skill modifications. What sort of modification is required for any particular skill or context is ultimately up to the Games Master to decide; according to the capabilities of the characters, his perception of the difficulty of the situation and the dramatic tension at that particular moment.

## Standard Skills

### Athletics (STR+DEX)

Athletics covers a range of physical activities, including climbing, jumping, throwing, and running. Skills rolls for any of these activities are handled by a single roll against the Athletics skill. See Movement in the Game System section for more information on climbing, jumping, and running.

### Boating (STR+CON)

The Boating skill covers the operation of small floating craft on rivers, lakes, and close inshore. Appropriate vessels are generally boats, canoes, or rafts which travel short distances and are unsuited to the rigours of the open sea. Most are propelled using oars, paddles, punts, or simple sails; or can even be towed by animals. Ships with large crews or designed for long, overseas journeys are covered under the Seamanship Professional Skill.

### Brawn (STR+SIZ)

Brawn is the efficient application of technique when applying raw physical force. The skill covers acts of applied might, including lifting, breaking down doors and contests of strength.

### Combat Style (STR+DEX)

Each Combat Style is the skill to use the weapons expected of a career or culture in the setting. Most fighting traditions encompass training in multiple weapons, along with the techniques required to use them all effectively, whether singly or in combination. In addition, they often assume a situational element, such as fighting as close order infantry or whilst mounted. Combat Styles can be very diverse, ranging from, for example, Gladiatorial Combat all the way to Space Marine Mobile Infantry.

### Conceal (DEX+POW)

Conceal is the counterpoint to Stealth, being the concealment of large objects rather than the character themselves. For instance, Conceal could be used to hide a chariot behind some rocks, or sweep away the wheel ruts it left so its path cannot be tracked. The skill is versatile in application, anything from hiding a scroll in a library to disguising the presence of a trap or secret passage.

### Customs (INT x2 +40)

Customs represents the character's knowledge of his own community: its social codes, rites, rituals, taboos, and so on. The skill is used when it is essential to accurately interpret or perform any socially important custom or to behave in a particular way.

### Dance (DEX+CHA)

Just about every culture uses dance in some way – either as recreation or as part of important rituals. It might be a court dance, a war dance, or a simple set of movements accompanying a prayer or ceremonial chant. The Dance skill measures a character's ability to move rhythmically and accurately (to a reasonable degree) when called upon to do so.

### Deceit (INT+CHA)

Deceit covers all instances where a character attempts to mask the truth and offer a deception of some kind: barefaced lying, misleading a guard, or even bluffing (or cheating) during a card game. The skill also covers instances where hiding true emotions or motives is necessary (feigning pleasure when one is bitterly disappointed perhaps, or attempting to seem welcoming and open when the opposite is true). Deceit forms a counterpart to the Insight skill and can be used to oppose Insight rolls when others are attempting to discern either truth or motive.

### Drive (DEX+POW)

Drive covers the control of wheeled or drawn vehicles, whether by one or more beasts of burden or powered by more esoteric means, such as chariots, sleds, sail carts, or even gasoline cars. A roll is also necessary if the vehicle being driven is drawn or powered by a means different than the driver is used to (horses instead of oxen, or a motor rather than animals for example).

### Endurance (CON x2)

Endurance is a character's capacity to endure physical stress, pain, and fatigue. It measures the body's ability to deal with potentially damaging or debilitating conditions and is a general gauge of resilience, stamina, and metabolism. Endurance, like its counterpart Willpower, is used in any number of ways, but most specifically to resist the possible effects of injuries, including harmful poisons and disease.

### Evade (DEX x2)

Evade is used to escape from observed, impending danger and can be used against Ranged Weapons (by diving for cover, for example), avoiding traps, changing the engagement distance in combat, and generally getting out of the way of a potential physical hazard. It can also be used as a resistance roll for certain types of magic. Using Evade usually leaves the character prone. Those with the Daredevil Combat Style Trait may use Evade to dodge a melee attack without falling prone and, against a ranged attack, they only end up prone if they fail the roll.

### First Aid (DEX+INT)

The skill of First Aid measures a character's ability to treat minor injuries and stabilise more severe ones. First Aid may be applied only once per specific injury and heals 1d3 points of damage.

### Influence (CHA x2)

This is a measurement of a character's ability to persuade others, through personal charisma, into a desired way of behaving. It is used in a wide variety of situations; from changing someone's mind, to bribing an official or guard. Influence rolls are typically opposed by the Perception, Willpower, or another Influence skill, depending on the circumstances, and are modified by how much a character is trying to influence behaviour. Attempting to persuade a close friend to loan you their horse may be relatively easy. Getting a usually incorruptible bureaucrat to accept a bribe is more difficult.

### Insight (INT+POW)

Insight is the ability to read or intuitively define another's verbal and non-verbal behaviour (such as body language or the manner of speech) to establish their motives and state of mind. Insight is used to determine whether someone is telling a lie (and it can be opposed by the other person's Deceit skill), or to predict how someone feels about a particular situation. Insight can equally be applied to particular situations as well as other people: Is that tavern a haven for trouble? Could the bandits be planning an ambush in the nearby hills?

### Locale (INT x2)

Locale measures a character's understanding of local flora, fauna, terrain, and weather in the area where he or she has spent much of their life, usually within their community. The character knows the common plants, trees, and animals, their properties and behaviour: where the best fish can be found; the movements of game creatures; where to find shelter; the likely weather for the season, and the most common regional dangers. In neighbouring, yet unfamiliar locations Locale should be made one or more grades harder.

### Native Tongue (INT+CHA+40)

Native Tongue is the ability to speak and read one's own language, the one learned while growing up in one's home culture. Native Tongue measures articulation, eloquence, and the depth of the speaker's vocabulary.

Unlike other skills, Native Tongue is not rolled against directly. Instead, it is treated as a static representation of overall fluency, limiting the level of conversational interaction. This is described in more detail under the Language skill, but starting characters usually begin play fully fluent in their mother tongue.

### Perception (INT+POW)

Perception is used for both passive observation and focused detection; whether hunting for something specific, a general scan of an area, or simple awareness of their surroundings. Specific conditions – darkness, for example – may affect the Difficulty Grade of the skill roll depending on the primary senses being used. Strong scents might make an olfactory Perception roll Easy rather than Standard, whereas trying to eavesdrop on a conversation in a crowded and noisy tavern would make the roll Hard.

### Ride (DEX+POW)

Ride covers the ability to control and remain mounted on those creatures that are trained to be ridden. The skill can be applied to a diverse range of beasts, everything from mules to elephants; even flying or swimming creatures such as giant eagles or dolphins. Riding an unfamiliar species is always one Difficulty Grade harder; while riding a species of a different medium (a horse rider riding a dragon, for example) is two grades harder. Wild, untamed creatures cannot be ridden in a constructive manner until they have been broken and trained to be riding beasts.

### Sing (POW+CHA)

Carrying a tune is covered by Sing, anything from monotonous chants through to complex arias. Singing is an inherent part of most cultures, a prime source of entertainment and perhaps used in its rituals. Important songs might be used for courting, inspiring soldiers before battle, or simply recounting a historical deed. The skill reflects the user's ability to maintain rhythm, keep in key and remember the correct words.

### Stealth (DEX+INT)

Hiding out of plain sight, or moving with minimal sound are covered by the Stealth skill. Cover and conditions, such as darkness or loud background noise, improve the grade of the skill according to the specifics of the environment. Similarly, adverse conditions, such as a lack of cover or a quiet night will decrease the skill's grade. Circumstances also affect the difficulty of the attempt. For instance, a warrior wearing heavy armor can easily conceal themselves behind a wall, provided they stand still or move very slowly, whereas moving quickly might cause their armor to jingle.

### Swim (STR+CON)

Without development, the ability to swim is limited to being able to thrash around and keep one's head above the water for a short time. Higher Swim percentages indicate being able to negotiate deeper and stronger waters, with less risk of drowning. Making a Swim roll thus depends entirely on the conditions. Rough seas, strong currents, white water, and rip tides all reduce the grade of the skill no matter what the character's affinity for water might be. See Movement for more information on swimming, including calculating swim speeds.

### Unarmed (STR+DEX)

Unarmed is a universal Combat Skill common to all characters, measuring the ability to defend oneself without the aid of weapons. The Unarmed skill covers the brawling and wrestling techniques known by that culture.

As Unarmed is a Combat Skill its Critical and Fumble effects are covered by the rules for combat, as detailed in the Combat chapter.

### Willpower (POW x2)

Willpower is a measure of a character's ability to concentrate, channel his force of will in a particular direction, or harden his psyche to possible mental shock. It is also a measure of personal resolve. The skill is used in all manner of situations where mental resilience is required, and this includes resisting magic. Although not a measure of sanity it can be used to endure traumatic events that would shake even the sanest, stable mind. Willpower is the mental counterpart to Endurance.

Again, like Endurance and Evade, Willpower is most often used in Opposed Rolls. When used as a Standard test, a Critical Willpower roll indicates that the character has hardened his mind and spirit to the extent that no further attempts to influence him, or shake his resolve, will work. In the case of resisting magic, a Critical Success means that no further mentally afflicting spells cast by the opponent have any effect on the character for the remainder of that encounter.

## Professional Skills

Professional Skills differ between characters and represent more specialised forms of training and experience. Some Professional Skills are gathered through cultural background and a character's Career, as the name suggests. Although they differ between characters they work in the same way as Standard Skills.

### Acting (CHA x2)

Acting governs the art of being able to impersonate and convey a completely different character, whether in a staged performance or in a social situation. The actor portrays a personality and mannerisms different to his own in a convincing manner. Coupled with the Disguise and Deceit skills, this is a powerful way of becoming someone else entirely.

### Acrobatics (STR+DEX)

Acrobatics covers acts of balance, gymnastics, juggling, and tumbling. The skill can be used to impress an audience, but also to help mitigate damage from falls. With a successful roll, a character can move at full speed and sure-footedly across an unstable or narrow surface. If trying to mitigate damage from an unexpected fall, a successful Acrobatics roll halves any damage sustained. In addition, if the roll is successful and the character does not suffer a Serious or Major Wound due to the fall, the character lands relatively safely and is not prone.

Acrobatics can be substituted for Evade if the situation warrants it. The benefit of this is that the character automatically regains their footing rather than being rendered prone.

### Astrogation (INT x2)

Astrogation is equivalent to Navigation, save that it enables starship pilots to plot a course at stellar and interstellar distances.

### Art (POW+CHA)

There are many specific art forms. Painting to Poetry; Literature to Sculpture. A character chooses an Art specialisation when taking this skill. Subsequent Art forms are advanced separately. A roll is made whenever a character must impress or convince through his artistic medium.

### Bureaucracy (INT x2)

Understanding administrative procedures, records, and unspoken conventions are covered by the Bureaucracy skill. It is used to interact with officials or discover pertinent civic information. Depending on the sophistication of their culture, bureaucrats need not necessarily be literate. Whenever red-tape or administrative landscapes need to be navigated, a Bureaucracy roll is necessary.

### Commerce (INT+CHA)

Commerce is used to evaluate the worth of goods and commodities and to trade them for the best possible price. It is also used to understand the intricacies of business transactions in addition to securing a profit. A further use is in finding the best way to dispose of stolen and illicit goods – again for the best possible price. Commerce is obviously used when trading and it can be opposed by either an opponent's Commerce skill or Willpower, reflecting the opposing side's attempts to further the deal in their favour. It is also used to judge the market value of goods, gaining an idea of price, and where it will be best traded.

### Comms (INT x2)

This skill grants the ability to use communications equipment to detect, conceal or block comms traffic. It also grants a chance of cracking encrypted messages (providing the user has access to a code-cracker).

### Computers (INT x2)

Computers reflects the character's ability to solve complex problems or extract complex information, using computer systems – be it through programming code, detailed use of a particular piece of software, hacking, and even diagnosing/repairing software and hardware problems. General use of computers does not usually require a roll.

### Courtesy (INT+CHA)

This skill covers understanding how to act appropriately in a social or formal situation: modes of address, rituals, and conventions of behavior, and so forth. It includes everything from who to bow to and when, to how low; from when to use a particular title to when it is appropriate to act informally.

### Craft (DEX+INT)

Each Craft is a specialised form, and there are as many crafts as there are professions for them. Like Art, Craft is used to create the subject item. How long it takes depends entirely on the nature of the product: weaving a rug takes longer than throwing a pot, for instance, but time is not necessarily the most important factor: it is the skill of the crafter, the quality of the resources and attention to detail.

### Culture (INT x2)

Culture is the more specific form of the Standard Skill of Customs, relating instead to societies foreign to the character's own. Each Culture skill must be given a particular nation or society to which it applies. Mechanically it works in the same way as the Customs skill.

### Demolitions (INT+POW)

This skill permits a character to safely handle and utilise explosive materials, whether setting them up or disarming them.

### Disguise (INT+CHA)

Effecting a convincing disguise, using appropriate materials (costumes, cosmetics, wigs, or hairpieces), is covered by the Disguise skill. Creating the disguise requires time and attention to detail, as well as access to the right materials to make it convincing. If some, or all, of these elements are not present then the Disguise roll's Difficulty Grade is made one or more steps harder.

Disguise can be augmented with Acting to enhance the overall effect of a deception (vice versa when performing) and so the two skills are complementary.

### Electronics (DEX+INT)

This skill allows the user to tinker with, bypass or repair electronic devices. It has many applications, most often to temporarily patch up damaged equipment or replace broken circuits with spares.

### Engineering (INT x2)

The design and building of large-scale structures, from houses to bridges, gates to siege engines, is in the remit of the Engineering skill. Rolls are necessary when planning large-scale projects to ensure correct construction but are also made when an engineer wants to assess a structure's integrity for whatever reason (state of repair or weak spots, for example).

### Forgery (DEX+INT)

The Forgery skill permits the creation or falsification of official documentation.

### Gambling (INT+POW)

The Gambling skill measures a character's competence in games of chance and especially where money is staked on the outcome. It is used to assess the odds of success or failure or spot when someone is cheating. The skill can be used in an opposed or unopposed manner, depending on the situation. Spending the night in a faceless gambling den might only require a straight test, whereas a high stakes dice game involving notable personages may instead require several Rounds of Opposed Rolls.

### Healing (INT+POW)

Healing is the in-depth knowledge of medical procedures, based on cultural practices and is used to treat more serious injuries (typically those where Hit Points are at zero or less). In a Primitive or Barbarian culture for instance, healing will be based on the knowledge of herbs and natural cures. In a Civilised culture, drugs and more advanced treatments will be more common. In all cultures Healing includes the ability to set bones, suture wounds, and so forth. Obviously applying Healing requires appropriate resources, and most practicing healers will have such things at hand (needles, gut or thread for sutures, herbs for poultices, and so forth, or a medical kit for modern settings).

### Language (INT+CHA)

This skill covers the speaking and comprehension of a language other than the character's own. The skill is treated as a static representation of overall fluency. 1-25% a few basic words, 26-50% simple sentences, 51-75% fluent for general conversation, 76+% able to converse eloquently. Its value is used by the Games Master to limit the level of spoken interaction when the players converse with personalities in the game. It can also be used as a cap for certain other skills (such as Bureaucracy), where Language may be a limiting factor. In such a case, a skill like Bureaucracy cannot exceed the skill value of the Language being used.

### Literacy (Specific Language) (INT x2)

Speaking a language fluently does not mean one can read and write it. Literacy is a specific skill and different societies display different levels and approaches towards it. In some, literacy is reserved for the nobility, bureaucratic or religious classes. In others it is unknown with oral traditions prevailing instead. In modern or futuristic societies literacy is learned by default and does not require a separate skill.

### Lockpicking (DEX x2)

Lockpicking is the ability to open a mechanical locking system without the aid of a key or other device made specifically for the lock. It includes the techniques of levering open bolted or barred doors and windows without causing damage. Lockpicking may also be used to lock a door, chest, and so on, when no key is available.

### Lore (INT x2)

Lore covers a specific body of knowledge which must be chosen when the skill is first learned. Alchemy, Astrology, Astronomy, Geography, Heraldry, History, Midwifery, Mineral, Monsters, Politics, Religion, Strategy and Tactics: these are all typical examples of Lore skills. Skill in a Lore means the character understands its fundamentals, how it can be applied to immediate challenges and problems, and can use the Lore to recall useful information.

### Magic (POW+CHA)

The Magic skill is used for casting the spells described in the Magic section of the Powers chapter. A successful roll is needed for a spell to work, although the spell may still be resisted by an opposing skill such as Willpower.

### Mechanisms (DEX+INT)

Mechanisms represents the knowledge and skill to assemble and disassemble mechanical devices, such as traps. The skill of Mechanisms generally involves the creation of delicate contraptions with small working parts, as opposed to Engineering, which deals with massive constructions. It is a distinct discipline from Lockpicking and cannot be interchanged with that skill.

### Musicianship (DEX+CHA)

Musicianship covers the playing of musical instruments; from a simple reed pipe to a complex stringed instrument such as a harp, and each iteration of Musicianship is applied to a group of similar instruments. A musician who can play a reed pipe can also play a flute, panpipes, or a recorder because the fundamentals are the same. They could not, however, play a harp or lute.

### Navigation (INT+POW)

Whether using prominent landmarks, the stars, or the varying taste of seawater, the ability to accurately direct travel is covered by the Navigation skill. Each Navigation skill covers a specific region or environment, such as Open Seas or Underground for example. It should be made during unusual journeys or when in completely unfamiliar territory.

### Oratory (POW+CHA)

Oratory is the art of delivering a speech to a large group of people with the aim of conveying or swaying a point of view. It is a skill frequently used by politicians to drive home a policy, but is also used by commanders to inspire troops and impose discipline on the battlefield. Wherever mass persuasion is needed, Oratory, rather than Influence, is used.

### Pilot (DEX+INT)

The Pilot skill permits the control of a specified class (such as gliders, prop-driven planes, jet engines, and so on) of flying vehicles.

### Politics (INT+CHA)

Characters possessing the Politics skill understand how to navigate and negotiate the corridors of government at local and national levels.

### Research (INT+POW)

Research uses various resources (such as a library, newspaper archive, computer network, and so on), to discover desired pieces of information.

### Science (INT x2)

There are dozens of scientific disciplines and the Science skill, which can be taken multiple times, is always associated with a discipline: Science (Biology) or Science (Chemistry), for example. Science replaces the Lore skill in modern and futuristic settings.

### Seamanship (INT+CON)

This skill is used in the same way as Boating but is instead applied to large waterborne vessels powered by sail or banks of oars. It also covers the maintenance and upkeep of a ship: assessing when repairs are needed, where it is safe to anchor, the dangers of violent weather, and so forth.

### Seduction (INT+CHA)

Seduction is the romantic or sexual persuasion of another person, a skill very different to Influence. It uses explicit signals – verbal and non-verbal – to elicit a sexually positive response. It also takes a significant amount of time: successful Seduction may take hours, days, or weeks to achieve depending on the morals of the target, who can always attempt to resist Seduction with Willpower.

### Sensors (INT+POW)

This skill allows the accurate use and analysis of sensor devices from chemical sniffers up to military long range scanners.

### Sleight (DEX+CHA)

Sleight covers attempts to palm or conceal small objects (legerdemain and prestidigitation) and includes attempts to pick pockets, cut purses, or cause a visual distraction. Naturally, it is an essential thieves' skill.

### Streetwise (POW+CHA)

Streetwise represents knowledge of places and social contacts within a settlement. It covers everything from identifying potentially dangerous neighbourhoods, to finding local services – legal or illegal. How long a Streetwise attempt takes depends on what is sought. Finding a good inn will take less time than locating a fence for stolen goods or a fake trading permit.

### Survival (CON+POW)

This skill covers surviving in a rural or wilderness environment where the benefits of civilisation are absent: foraging, building a fire, finding shelter or a safe place to sleep. When properly equipped, rolls are usually unnecessary since the character may be carrying a tent, food supplies, and so on. Only when separated from their equipment or when environmental conditions turn bad does it become essential to use this skill. A roll is usually made once per day in such conditions.

### Teach (INT+CHA)

Teach allows the user to pass on their knowledge and techniques in an easy to understand and constructive manner. Without this skill even the most capable of masters will suffer problems instructing others.

### Track (INT+CON)

The Track skill is used for tracking any form of game or quarry. It uses both obvious and ambiguous signs of passing to remain on the quarry's trail, including footprints, bruised leaves, scattered pollen, displaced rocks, and so on; small, tell-tale signs that are invisible to the non-skilled. Track rolls need to be made periodically, especially if conditions change abruptly (a rain shower, for example, will disturb certain signs). How often depends on how cunning the quarry has been. Conceal rolls can be used to oppose a Track roll.

## Skill Rules for Different Circumstances andSituations

Although the basic rules for using skills in _Mythras Imperative_ are very straightforward, there are a multitude of different circumstances that arise during play that require skills to be handled in a slightly different way. The following sections look at these circumstances and situations and show how to handle them.

### Reattempting Skills

In some situations, a character will Fail a skill attempt but be left in a situation where they could potentially try again. Example cases might be picking a lock or attempting to climb a sheer wall. Instead of simply denying any further attempts, kindly Games Masters may permit a follow-up, last-ditch attempt. However, the character will suffer some trepidation or lack of confidence which increases the Difficulty Grade of the skill roll by one.

If this second effort also ends in failure, the character is assumed to have given it his 'best shot' and cannot make any further attempts for the foreseeable future.

### Opposed Rolls

Skills are frequently pitted against other skills – Stealth versus Perception when a rogue attempts to cut a nobleman's purse, say; or Deceit versus Insight when the same rogue tries to deny the attempt when she is caught – are good examples of times where skills are matched against each other. These are known as Opposed Rolls and are used where a challenge will result in either win or lose, passpass, or fail.

- An Opposed Roll is determined thus: both participants roll their respective skills. The winner is the one who gains the better Level of Success. If the participants score the same Level of Success (a Standard Success each, or a Critical each), then the winner is the one who has the highest dice roll still within the success range of the skill.

If both participants Fail in an Opposed Roll, then either:

- Describe the situation, leaving both sides hanging in dramatic tension, then re-roll the contest to establish a winnerwinner.
- The Games Master should produce some explanation or circumstances that suit the nature of the failurefailure.

Opposed Rolls are frequently used in certain battle situations to overcome the effects of wounds or oppose a combat Special Effect. They are also used to resist poisons and disease or shrug off the effects of baleful magic.

**Opposed Roll Examples**

| Activity | Opposed Skill Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Bargaining/Haggling | Commerce vs. Commerce, Influence vs. Commerce |
| Chasing/Racing | Athletics vs. Athletics, Athletics vs. Endurance, Ride vs. Ride |
| Deceiving or Lying | Deceit vs. Insight, Sleight vs. Perception |
| Displaying Loyalty | Passion vs. Passion, Passion vs. Insight, Passion vs. Influence |
| Getting out of the Way | Evade vs. Athletics, Evade vs. Mechanisms, Evade vs. Ride |
| Hiding or Sneaking | Stealth vs. Perception; Stealth vs. Track |
| Pulling Rank | Influence vs. Willpower, Deceit vs. Willpower |
| Staying the Course | Endurance vs. Endurance, Endurance vs. Brawn |
| Swaying a Crowd | Oratory vs. Willpower |
| Test of Strength | Brawn vs. Brawn, Brawn vs. Endurance |
| Test of Wills | Willpower vs. Willpower, Seduction vs. Willpower |

### Differential Rolls

Differential Rolls are similar to Opposed Rolls except that instead of a simple win or lose result, the difference in Levels of Success areis calculated. Primarily used for the resolution of combat ,combat, Differential Rolls can also be used in other situations where the Games Master wishes to increase the detailed results of a contest.

A Differential Roll is determined in the following manner: Both participants roll against their respective skills and suffer the results of their roll as if tested in isolation. There is no outright 'winner' per se, but whoever gained the higher Level of Success gains an advantage equal to the difference in the success levels between them (assuming one participant gains at least a Standard success or better). If both participants score the same Level of Success (a Standard success each, or a Critical each), then there is no additional effect.

**Differential Roll Results**

| Result of Rolls | Antagonist Critical | Antagonist Success | Antagonist Failure | Antagonist Fumble |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Protagonist Critical | No Benefit | Protagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | Protagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success | Protagonist Wins 3 Levels of Success |
| Protagonist Success | Antagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | No Benefit | Protagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | Protagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success |
| Protagonist Failure | Antagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success | Antagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | No Benefit | No Benefit |
| Protagonist Fumble | Antagonist Wins 3 Levels of Success | Antagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success | No Benefit | No Benefit |

### Opposed Skills Over 100%

If the highest skilled participant in an Opposed or Differential Roll has a skill more than 100%, that participant subtracts the difference between 100 and his skill value from the skill of everyone in the contest, including himself. This reduces the skill value of the opponents but leaves him retaining the advantage.

The identification of who has the highest skill must be calculated after any other modifiers for circumstances have been applied.

### So, Just How Good Are You?

It can be very useful for both Games Masters and Players to have a common frame of reference for what the value of a skill translates to as a comparable level of competence. Is a craftsman with Craft Wood 48% a good carpenter or merely a competent one? The Competence Level Table helps summarise the different levels of competence one can expect a rating in a skill to represent; it is also a handy reference for Games Masters when assigning general values to skills for Non-Player Characters and adversaries. If a random value for a Non-Player Character skill is needed, then the Random Value column gives the dice code to obtain a value within a desired Competency Level.

**Competency Level Table**

| Skill Rating | Random Value | Competence Level | Military Equivalent | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-30% | 1d20+10 | Novice | Cannon Fodder | Unqualified and learning the basics |
| 31-50% | 1d20+30 | Competent | Green | Can perform easy tasks if taking time to be careful |
| 51-70% | 1d20+50 | Proficient | Seasoned | Has reached an employable level of competence |
| 71-90% | 1d20+70 | Expert | Veteran | Recognised as a professional or subject matter expert in the field |
| 91-110% | 1d20+90 | Master | Elite | Considered one of the best in the business |
| \>110% | 1d20+110 | Exemplar | Heroic | Renowned far and wide for their consummate skill |

# Game System

Many different things can occur during a _Mythras Imperative_ game. Some are resolved through skill use or one of the major game mechanics such as combat or magic; others require their own rules for adjudication. This chapter provides rules and guidance for a variety of different scenarios that players will encounter while playing the game.

The list is not exhaustive but should represent the most common situations. If Games Masters find there are other situations that require some form of game system adjudication, and that these situations seem to occur frequently, then they are encouraged to develop their own rules to cover these special circumstances, using those given in this chapter as a basis for replication or development.

## Asphyxiation

Characters can hold their breath for a number of seconds equal to their Endurance skill. However, the character must be prepared (filling the lungs with as much air as possible); if not, then the period is halved if the character was in a passive situation, or reduced to one-fifth if the character was engaged in strenuous activity.

Once the period of held breath is over, characters must make an Endurance roll:

- If the roll is a Critical Success, no further deterioration occurs.
- If the roll is Successful, the character accrues an extra level of Fatigue.
- If the roll Fails, the character sustains 1d2 extra levels of Fatigue that Round.
- If the roll is Fumbled, the character sustains 1d3 extra levels of Fatigue that Round.

Without aid, death from Asphyxiation is usually swift. If the Asphyxiation ends before the character dies, they recover Fatigue levels lost to suffocation relatively quickly, regaining one level per minute.

Depending on the method of Asphyxiation, the Games Master may wish to prevent full recovery, imposing an enduring level of Fatigue (see page 28) to represent damage to the lungs caused by smoke or water inhalation.

## Character Improvement

Every _Mythras Imperative_ character can improve with time and experience. Improvement can be undertaken in several areas:

- Increasing existing skills
- Increasing Passions
- Learning new skills
- Learning new Abilities

### Experience Rolls

The mechanism for most character improvement is the Experience Roll. Games Masters dispense Experience Rolls at an appropriate juncture in the campaign: at the end of every successful scenario or storyline; or after perhaps two or three sessions of play if the story is a long one which will take time to complete. The frequency is at the Games Master's discretion. A high frequency of Experience Rolls will lead to the characters developing at a faster rate.

There is no right or wrong time to give Experience Rolls, but natural breaks in the story may suggest suitable times. The Games Master is, however, always the decision maker here. While players cannot demand Experience Rolls, they have a right to expect them at certain points – as their characters will not be able to develop without them.

The number of Experience Rolls awarded is also determined by the Games Master. However, a good rule of thumb is 1-3 Experience Rolls per session since the last time they were awarded.

### Increasing Existing Skills

Any skill on the Character Sheet, Standard or Professional, can be increased by spending one Experience Roll. Players can elect not to spend Experience Rolls on increasing skills, instead building up a stockpile for use in increasing other things – such as Class abilities (see below).

The player rolls 1d100 and compares it to the skill being increased. The character's INT is added to the roll.

- If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the skill being improved, it increases by 1d4+1%.
- If the number rolled is less than the skill selected, the skill still increases, but only by 1%.
- If a character **Fumbled any skill during the preceding session(s) – i.e., between the last set of Experience Rolls and the present one – the Fumbled skill gains a free increase of 1%. We learn more** from our mistakes than our successes and this represents the reflection a character undergoes following a disastrous failure. Multiple Fumbles of the same skill do not stack. In a case where the Fumbled skill is also being raised with an Experience Roll, the 1% from the Fumble is applied before the roll is made to improve it.

The same skill may not benefit from more than one Experience Roll per session.

### Increasing Passions

As described under Passions in the Passions sec, the value of a Passion may be increased with Experience Rolls in the same way as a skill. If supported by play, the Games Master might even allow a Passion to be reduced using an Experience Roll.

_For example, constant spurning from an unrequited love might eventually wear down the Passion of even the most ardent lover, especially one who wishes to pursue a relationship without the ghosts of the past haunting them._

### Learning New Skills

Some characters may wish to study new Professional Skills which they never had the chance to learn from their culture. Before they can start investing Experience Rolls, they must first find a source of knowledge from which to learn. This could be as prosaic as a professional tutor such those provided by orders or guilds. Alternately it might be a more exotic source of education such as an ancient and crumbling training scroll.

Once a source of education is found, the character must spend an entire month of study and practice to garner a basic grounding in that skill (learn at Base Level). This costs 3 Experience Rolls plus whatever in-game costs are required to pay the teacher (if one exists) and purchase (or rent) whatever equipment and tools may be needed.

## Disease and Poison

Some of the most feared things which can affect characters are the myriad diseases and poisons which infest the dark and grim places of the world. There's nothing quite as unsettling than a plague which strikes the character's home city, especially when they are still within its gates. Likewise finding a venomous serpent in the bed or being attacked by giant scorpions can be moments of high drama.

Diseases and poisons are near infinite in their varieties but, for game purposes, are handled in the same way.

### Disease and Poison Traits

All diseases and poisons manifest a number of traits important to their effects.

_**Application**_ – The method of how the disease or poison is introduced into the victim.

_**Ingestion**_ – Effects take place through either eating or drinking.

_**Inhaled**_ – Effects take place through breathing or snorting.

_**Contact**_ – Effects take place through absorption through the skin.

_**Injected**_ – Effects take place when the substance is injected into the body through piercing.

_**Potency**_: The virulence of the disease or poison. This value is set against an appropriate resisting skill (usually Endurance or Willpower) in an Opposed Roll. If the character wins the rollroll, they shrug off its effects. If they lose the roll, then they suffer all ofall the disease or poison Conditions, each at the appropriate time.

_**Resistance**_: How the disease or poison is resisted – either Endurance or Willpower, butWillpower but may have more exotic resistance requirements. Resistance can be rolled at the time of exposure or deferred until the Onset Time to conceal the fact the character might have been infected or poisoned.

_**Onset Time**_: Many diseases and poisons do not take immediate effect. The delay is called the Onset Time, and this can be a matter of seconds, minutes, hours, or even longer. Poisons or diseases possessing multiple effects may have different onset times for each one as described under Conditions.

_**Duration**_: How long a disease or poison's Conditions last.

_**Conditions**_: Every toxin has one or more Conditions. These have specific effects as described in the Conditions table, below, and if a victim fails to resistresist, he suffers all the Conditions described.

_**Antidote/Cure**_: If the toxin can be treated it will be noted here. Successful treatment prevents any further conditions from occurring, yet in some circumstances may leave the victim suffering enduring effects that have already been inflicted.

**Conditions Table**

| **Condition** | **Effects** |
| --- | --- |
| Agony | The victim is hindered by intense pain. Whether in a location or the entire body, any skill roll involving use of the affected area must also be less or equal to the character's Willpower, otherwise the attempt fails, and they moan or scream in pain. |
| Asphyxiation | The victim  suffers asphyxiation – he collapses incapacitated, unable to breathe. The rules for Asphyxiation, found on page 71, are used. Asphyxiation may be asthmatic in nature meaning the victim only suffers shortness of breath, or complete respiratory failure resulting in death. In the laterlatter case a victim can be kept alive by winning an opposed test of the First Aid skill against the Potency of the dieasedisease or poison. |
| Bleeding | The victim suffers from either internal bleeding or surface haemorrhaginghemorrhaging which leads to the effects described in the Blood Loss section on in the Game System section. |
| Contagious | The victim Victim can transfer the poisonpoison or disease by touch. |
| Death | The victim collapses incapacitated, andincapacitated and dies after a number of rounds equal to their CON characteristic. |
| Fever | The victim's body temperature fluctuates wildly – from hot to cold – and muscles ache. All skills suffer a difficulty grade of Hard. |
| Mania | The victim is driven to follow some compulsion;compulsion, such as avoiding water, paranoia, self mutilationself-mutilation, and so forth. The mania induced by the disease or poison will be noted in its description. |
| Nausea | The victim cannot eat, and must roll against his Endurance every time he performs a stressful physical action to avoid being physically sick. Vomiting lasts for 1d3 rounds during which he cannot act. Long durations of Nausea may cause starvation. |
| Paralysis | The victim is unable physically to move. The affected area, if a location, cannot be used for the duration. If it affects the whole body, the character cannot move at all. |

#### Sample Disease: Red Pox

Red pox is a nasty disease spread by skin contact with a person already infected, or with something they have touched. The chance of catching the disease from an object remains for 1d3 days after contact, making it quite difficult to contain the disease once an outbreak occurs.

Victims initially suffer a minor rash, but within a day come down with a serious fever which usually renders them bedridden for the entire duration. During this timetime, the rash evolves into gruesomely itchy pustules which burst open at the slightest movement, weeping small trickles of blood – especially from the armpits and groin. This stage can last up to a week or more, potentially proving fatal.

- Application: Contact
- Potency: 50
- Resistance: Endurance
- Onset time: 1d6+6 hours
- Duration: 1d6+3 days
- Conditions: Once the disease manifests the victim becomes Contagious. 1 day later they begin to suffer Fever and Bleeding. Each day the pustules weep blood the victim loses one level of Fatigue, which does not recover until the duration of the disease has completed.
- Antidote/Cure: Can be cured by the Healing skill.

## Falling

The amount of damage suffered in a fall depends on the distance of the drop. Armor Points do not reduce falling damage, but the Damage Modifier of the falling character or creature applies to the damage suffered from the fall.

**Falling Distance Table**

| **Distance Fallen** | **Damage Taken** |
| --- | --- |
| **1 metre or less** | No damage. |
| **2-5 metres** | 1d6 points of damage to one random location. |
| **6-10 metres** | 2d6 points of damage to two random locations. |
| **11-15 metres** | 3d6 points of damage to three random locations. |
| **16-20 metres** | 4d6 points of damage to four random locations. |
| **Each +5 metres** | +1d6 damage. |

### Falling Objects

A falling object imparts an amount of damage based on its SIZ and the distance of the fall. An object imparts 1d6 damage for every 6 points of SIZ (or fraction thereof), plus an amount of damage equal to the Damage Taken column of the Falling Distance Table – including any reductions for objects of smaller size.

## Fatigue

Fatigue measures tiredness and its incremental effects. It is used to track many different things, from strenuous activity to the debilitating effects of disease.

The primary way of accruing Fatigue is by engaging in some form of physical activity. The more arduous the exercise or work, the more quickly it tires the character. At the Games Master's discretion, characters must make an appropriate skill roll – either Athletics, Brawn, or Endurance – to resist gaining a level of Fatigue.

Every Failed roll accrues a level of Fatigue. Each level of Fatigue carries penalties for skill use, movement, Initiative, and Action Points. Asphyxiation, Blood Loss, and other setting dependent effects also contribute to Fatigue Accrual.

For most characters, activities of any kind become near impossible when the level of Incapacitated is reached. At this stagestage, the character is still conscious but incapable of anything but the most desperate of activities.

Beyond Incapacitated, characters cannot act at all. The Fatigue levels – Semi-Conscious, Comatose, and Dead – are generally reserved for measuring the most extreme effects of suffocation, disease, blood loss, starvation, exposure, and so forth.

### Recovering from Fatigue

Characters recover from Fatigue depending on their Healing Rate. The amount of complete rest needed to recover from each level of accrued Fatigue is equal to the Recovery Period divided by the character's Healing Rate.

Note that the table below represents Fatigue recovery for physical exertion. Fatigue recovery can be much faster when recovering from Asphyxiation or slower if recuperating from Blood Loss.

**Fatigue Levels**

| **Fatigue Level** | **Skill Grade** | **Movement** | **Initiative** | **Action Points** | **Recovery Period** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fresh | – | – | No Penalties | – | – |
| Winded | Hard | No Penalties | No Penalties | No Penalties | 15 minutes |
| Tired | Hard | -1 metre | No Penalties | No Penalties | 3 hours |

## Fires

Fires are always a source of danger when used as a weapon or rage out of control. The Fire Intensity table below gives five different intensities for heat damage, with some examples. The damage inflicted per Round is given in the Damage column. Being relatively small, Intensity 1 and 2 sources apply their damage to a single Hit Location, usually that touching the source. Intensity 3 and 4 sources are larger, applying damage to nearest 1d4+1 Hit Locations, indicating the degree of radiant heat. Intensity 5 sources affect all Hit Locations simultaneously.

Fire can ignite flammable materials. If not extinguished immediately such materials combust within a number of Rounds as indicated by the fire's Intensity. Once ignited, flammable materials burn until physically extinguished. Damage is applied directly to the Hit Points of the material, ignoring Armor Points, and to any flesh beneath. If left. uncontrolled it spreads to a number of Hit Locations, per Round, equal to its Intensity.

**Fire Intensity Table**

| Intensity | Examples | Time to Ignite | Damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Candle | 1d4 | 1d2 |
| 2 | Torch | 1d3 | 1d4 |
| 3 | Campfire | 1d2 | 1d6 |
| 4 | Room filling conflagration | 1d2 | 2d6 |
| 5 | Volcanic lava | Instant | 3d6 |

Fire-based attacks typically have a percentage chance of igniting flammable materials as they are generally over in a single Round. Unless otherwise noted, this chance is damage rolled x5% for fire-based attacks, and damage rolled x1% for electrical. Once ignited, flammable materials burn for 1d3-1 damage every Round until physically extinguished. Apply this damage directly to the Hit Points of the material, ignoring Armor Points, and to any flesh beneath. A creature's natural Armor offers its normal protection, however. The victim may attempt to smother the flames by dropping prone and making a successful Athletics roll, which requires an Action Point and may be attempted each Turn. If others assist in smothering the flames in some way, the roll is one Difficulty Grade easier. If the damage roll results in zero damage, the fire has gone out on its own in that one location. For each location that had gone out on its own, the roll to smother the flames is also one Difficulty Grade easier.

## Game Time

In _Mythras Imperative_, time is an important factor, mostly to determine what happens in what order, so that game mechanics are applied when they should be. Remember that in-game time is usually not equivalent to time spent playing. Sometimes, the GM may need to summarise the events of many days in a single sentence, such as 'It takes you a week to reach Castle Anthrax,' while at other times, particularly during combat, the actions of only a few seconds of time can take several minutes or longer to resolve.

Following are the important distinctions of game time:

### Combat Rounds

A Combat Round represents five seconds of real time. They are used to measure short, frenetic bursts of activity that take moments to complete or measuring very detailed activities that require a blow-by-blow resolution. For example, a chase between hunter and prey where each Round determines the twists and turns of the pursuit.

### Skill Time

Skill Time represents a few minutes to a few hours and is used to measure activities that do not require the detailed attention of a Combat Round but require a specific deliberation of effort with a definite result. Picking a lock might take five minutes, whereas observing the patrols made by teams of guards around a castle's walls might require several hours and are both examples of Skill Time.

### Narrative Time

This is the amount of time taken when the Games Master is narrating to the players, or when the players are discussing. Unless there is a specific reason for it, most actual roleplaying takes place in narrative time. When roleplaying, narrative time resembles real time, where a conversation takes as long to have as it takes to play. If a game session includes lengthy travel, or periods of activity where exact time is not of the essence, then time is compressed greatly to a few moments of game time.

## Hit Locations

Most successful (weapon) attacks land on a specific Hit Location. This can be determined randomly or in some circumstances be selected by Special Effects such as Choose Location. To randomly calculate which location is been hit, roll 1d20 and compare the number rolled with the relevant humanoid or creature Hit Location table.

Animals and monsters usually have slightly different Hit Location tables than humanoids to reflect their own unique physiology. These are listed as part of each being's description and is typically only of use to the Games Master.

The humanoid Hit Location table is repeated here for ease of reference.

#### Humanoid Hit Locations

| 1d20 | Hit Location |
| --- | --- |
| 1-3 | Right Leg |
| 4-6 | Left. Leg |
| 7-9 | Abdomen |
| 10-12 | Chest |
| 13-15 | Right Arm |
| 16-18 | Left. Arm |
| 19-20 | Head |

Note that some attacks, especially magical, technological or those produced by particular monsters (a dragon's fiery breath or an exploding grenade for example), may strike several Hit Locations simultaneously. Individual Hit Locations may be armored, either from worn protection or the natural toughness of the creature's outer surface. This is important when considering Damage and Wound Levels below.

### Damage and Wound Levels

If an attack strikes successfully, it causes damage according to the damage rating for the weapon. A shortsword, for instance, inflicts 1d6 damage.

The rolled damage for the weapon or attack is modified by the certain conditions in the specific following order:

1. Apply the Damage Modifier for the character making the attackattack.
2. Modify the damage from any weapon enhancing (or reducing) magicmagic.
3. If parried, reduce the damage appropriately as per the comparative weapon sizessizes.
4. If the Hit Location is armored, reduce damage by the Armor Points valuevalue.

If the damage inflicted by the attack is above zero, then the Hit Location sustains that amount of damage, with the damage total being immediately removed from the location's Hit Points. Note how many Hit Points the location has remaining, and the wound category that results.

- _**Minor Wound**_: Hit Location still has positive Hit Points
- _**Serious Wound**_: Hit Location is reduced to zero Hit Points or belowbelow.
- _**Major Wound**_: Hit Location is reduced to a negative score equal or greater than its starting Hit Points

Use the following rules if a location receives a Serious or Major Wound. Note that wounds requiring Endurance checks test them in an Opposed Roll against the value of the original attack roll. This reflects the ability of highly skilled warriors to make more deadly strikes. Endurance rolls are not repeated unless the location is wounded again.

### Minor Wound

Minor wounds are cuts, scratches, bruises, and sprains. They hurt, may bleed, but are not significant enough to slow down or hamper the victim.

### Serious Wound

If a location is reduced to zero Hit Points or below, the victim receives a Serious Wound. The location is permanently scarred, and the victim cannot attack or start to cast spells (but can still Parry or Evade) for the next 1d3 Turns due to being stunned or distracted by the pain of the wound.

A character suffering a Serious Wound to a limb must immediately make an Opposed Roll of his Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in the limb being rendered useless, until the location is restored to positive Hit Points. If a leg, the victim drops prone. If an arm, whatever is being held drops, unless the object is strapped on (use common sense here).

A character suffering a Serious Wound to the abdomen, chest, or head must immediately make an Opposed Roll of his Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness for a number of minutes equal to the amount of damage sustained in the attack causing the Serious Wound. The First Aid or Healing skills can be used to help an unconscious victim back to consciousness.

At the Games Master's discretion, even if the character remains functional, all tasks requiring use of that Hit Location will suffer an ongoing penalty of one Difficulty Grade, until the injury is reduced to a Minor Wound.

### Major Wound

If a location is reduced to a negative score equal to or greater than its starting Hit Points, the character receives a Major Wound. The character is immediately Incapacitated, unable to continue fighting. A limb is severed, transfixed, shattered, or ripped off by a Major Wound. The character drops prone, physically Incapacitated, and must immediately make an Opposed Roll of Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness from the agony. If a severed, punctured, or ripped off location is not treated within a number of minutes equal to five times his Healing Rate, the character dies from blood loss and shock.

The victim of a Major Wound to the abdomen, chest, or head drops unconscious, totally Incapacitated, and must immediately make an Opposed Roll of Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in an instant and gratuitous death (decapitated, chopped in half, impaled through the heart, torn apart, and so forth). If they survive, and the location is not treated within a number of Combat Rounds equal to twice the character's Healing Rate, they still die from blood loss and shock.

Since most Major Wounds require some form of surgery or significant magic to heal, the sufferer will be very unlikely to recover from a Major Wound in time to rejoin combat. Depending on the available treatment, the wounded location will be potentially maimed (see Healing from Injury page opposite).

### Blood Loss

Blood Loss due to external and internal wounds, usually sustained in combat, can wear a character down very quickly. Its effects are measured by the accumulation of Fatigue levels, much like Asphyxiation. Unrestrained Blood Loss typically results in death without some form of medical attention. Unlike Asphyxiation, the effects of serious Blood Loss on Fatigue are enduring. A character recovers Fatigue lost to bleeding at a rate of one level per day, starting the day after his exsanguinations cease.

### Heroic Last Actions

In special cases where key characters receive a Major Wound, the Games Master might allow a heroic last Action – such as spitting out one last spell, attempting to cut down their slayer, crawling away to hide, or trying to tourniquet their own wound. They must have working limbs applicable to the Action and burn a Luck Point. They get a single opportunity to attempt their Action, and then immediately collapse into unconsciousness, and probable death.

## Healing from Injury

Natural healing from wounds and injuries is based on the character's Healing Rate. The Healing Rate dictates how many Hit Points are recovered in a location depending on the injury's nature:

_**Minor Wounds**_: Days

_**Serious Wounds**_: Weeks

_**Major Wounds**_: Months

Thus, a character with a Healing Rate of 3 who suffers damage taking him to –3 in a Hit Location, a Serious Wound, will heal naturally at a rate of 3 Hit Points per week until his wound goes above zero, and then heal 3 Hit Points per day until fully recovered.

There are certain restrictions on natural healing:

- The healing character cannot engage in strenuous activity: otherwise, the Healing Rate is reduced by 1d3. Thus, a character recovering from even a Minor Wound could find his progress halted if they decide to engage in any physical tasks that might exacerbate the injuries.
- Natural healing will not begin to heal a Major Wound until the victim has been treated with a successful Healing roll ,roll, or the casting of one of some form of healing magic. Non-dismembering Major Wounds which are not treated within a number of days equal to one twentieth of the Healing skill become maimed, permanently reducing the Hit Points of the location.

## Inanimate Objects

All inanimate objects possess Armor Points and Hit Points which are used to determine resistance to damage and destruction. Armor Points reduce damage before Hit Points are affected. Once an object's Hit Points have been reduced to zero, it is useless.

Breakage attempts require a character to make a Brawn, Unarmed or Combat Style roll, as appropriate, to inflict damage. A success deals damage to the item.

### Weapons vs Inanimate Objects

Using a weapon against an inanimate object with Armor Points equal to or greater than those of the weapon deals damage to both the object and the weapon. For instance, using an axe on an iron door may damage the door, but the axe itself will be destroyed long before the iron door is. The Games Master should exercise discretion on which weapons or tools can affect which objects. A chisel, for example, is explicitly designed to carve wood or stone whilst a sword, although sharp, is not. The chisel would therefore not take damage from something it is attempting to carve whereas a sword most likely would.

**Inanimate Objects**

| Object | Armor Points/Hit Points |
| --- | --- |
| Castle Gate | 8/150 |
| Castle Wall | 10/500 |
| Chain/Shackle | 8/8 |
| Iron Post | 8/15 |
| Glass Window | 1/4 |
| Iron Door | 12/30 |
| Rope | 6/3 |
| Wooden Chair | 4/15 |
| Brick Wall | 6/30 |
| Concrete Wall | 8/40 |
| Automobile | 6/30 |
| Bulletproof Glass | 8/25 |
| Steel Beam | 12/50 |
| Armored Personnel Carrier | 10/50 |
| Battle Tank | 15/100 |
| Truck/Excavator | 8/40 |
| Tree Trunk | 6/50 |

## Luck Points

Luck Points help differentiate heroes from the rank and file. They represent a character's ability to potentially turn failure into success and even cheat death.

Luck Points can be used during play and, at the beginning of the next session, replenish to their usual value.

### Using Luck Points

Luck points can be used in a variety of ways. Only one Luck Point can be used in support of a particular Action. Luck Points cannot be spent on Experience or Training rolls. Each of the following options costs a single Luck Point.

#### Cheat Fate

Characters can use a Luck Point to re-roll or swap (a 75 would become a 57 for example) any dice roll they make. This can be a skill roll, damage roll, or anything else that has some effect. Characters can even force an opponent to re-roll an attack or damage roll made against them.

#### Desperate Effort

If a character has exhausted their Action Points during a fight and needs to find that last burst of desperate energy to perhaps avoid a messy demise, they may spend a Luck Point to gain an additional Action Point.

#### Mitigate Damage

A character who suffers a Major Wound may spend a Luck Point to downgrade the injury to a Serious Wound. This reduces the damage taken to one Hit Point less than what would be required to inflict a Major Wound.

# Combat

Combat is an important feature of roleplaying games. Violent confrontation has ever been a way of settling problems, from vengeance-driven fights between nemeses, to the clash of armies in times of war. Nevertheless, combat need not be a savage battle to the death. Some combat encounters can be swashbuckling duels which end without injury, or perhaps light-hearted bar room brawls. _Mythras Imperative_ uses several terms to explain the core elements of combat. These are explained in the following sections, but in overview, these are:

### Combat Style

The skill of wielding a group of weapons learned as part of a culture or profession.

### Combat Rounds

Bookkeeping time segments of five seconds each.

### Combat Actions

Possible acts a character can perform during a Round by the expenditure of an Action Point.

### Weapon Size

How difficult it is to parry a particular weapon.

### Engagement

When combatants can hit or be hit by a direct opponent, depending on circumstances.

### Special Effects

Combat manoeuvres which can be performed if one combatant gains the upper hand.

## Combat Styles

Combat Style represents a 'package' of multiple weapons related by their nature, which avoids the necessity of learning each individual weapon separately.

The most important aspect of Combat Skill is that the character learns how to use each weapon in the skill, both singly and in combination so that they might be interchanged, as necessary. Combat training does not focus merely on using a specific weapon or weapons under best conditions, but also covers what to do when placed at a severe disadvantage. Such cross-training is a primary part of preparing a combatant for the unpredictable events of the battlefield, where weapon breakage or becoming disarmed is always a potential possibility.

Thus, a Hyberborean barbarian may be expected to know how to use a spear, hand axe, javelin, and shield, whereas a Summerian warrior may be trained in shortsword, mace, shield, and bow instead. Deciding how many weapons should be included into a single style is ultimately a choice determined by the Games Master and the setting of the game.

Characters who attempt to use a weapon not covered by their style should suffer a skill penalty of one or more difficulty grades.

Combat styles possess another function beyond simply learning a group of weapon skills. Since each style is taught by a particular culture or career, they are inherently optimised for the environment or military tactics that group normally fights with; for instanceinstance, a horse nomad learns to fight from the saddle, or an infantryman trains to fight in close order formation. Therefore, as an additional bonus, some Combat Styles may be assigned one or more traits which grants it an advantage under certain circumstances. Traits are only intended to be used with the weapons and situations of that particular style. Obviously, there are countless traits, many of which are specific to a particular period or campaign world.

**Combat Style Traits**

| Trait | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Beast-back Lancer | Performing a mounted charge with this combat style does not incur the one step difficulty penalty to hit. |
| Blind Fighting | Allows user to ignore any penalties imposed due to poor lighting or temporary blinding |
| Daredevil | May use the Evade skill to dodge blows in hand-to-hand combat without ending up prone |
| Defensive Minded | Increases the Size of your weapon when parrying by one step, provided no offensive action is taken that round |
| Formation Fighting | Permits an unflanked group of three or more warriors to draw into close formation, placing more open or disordered opponents at a disadvantage and reducing each foe's Action Points by one if they engage |
| Knockout Blow | When attacking with surprise treat any Stun Location as lasting minutes instead of turns |
| Mounted Combat | Allows character to ignore the skill cap placed upon combat rolls by the Ride skill |
| Ranged Marksman | When using a ranged weapon, shift a random Hit Location roll to an adjoining body location |
| Skirmishing | The style permits launching ranged attacks whilst walking or running |
| Throw Weapons | Any melee weapon in the style can also be thrown at no penalty to skill, but when used in this way a weapon's damage roll is halved. |
| Unarmed Prowess | Permits the user to treat his Unarmed blocks and parries as 'Medium' sized, enabling him to better defend himself from armed opponents. |

## Running Combat

To emphasise its visceral nature, combat is tracked on a blow-by-blow basis. To ease bookkeeping, fights are broken down into Combat Rounds of five seconds each. During this period combatants may make hand-to-hand attacks or defend against them, manoeuvre into and out of combat, fire or throw a Ranged Weapon, and so on. Similar toLike real life, most combat engagements – once joined – are concluded in a matter of seconds rather than minutes. In game terms this means several Combat Rounds, unless participants withdraw to perhaps reset Initiative, reassess their tactical situation, or simply to grab a momentary rest before re-engaging. Only fights between well matched foes or sequences of opponents tend to last longer.

## Firearms

If using firearms in a _Mythras Imperative_ game, there are a few things to consider given the lethality of a firefight. First, it is near impossible to avoid laser beams or bullets which travel faster than human reflexes. Using the combat rules as presented, this means that unless one tries to dive clear of the area using Evade, any hit will immediately expose the victim to one or more Special Effects .Effects. It also changes the Action Point economy. If you can't use points to reactively defend yourself then most characters will end up using all their actions to blast away, gambling on the incompetence of their foes. To handle this paradigm shift, both Game Masters and Players may need to change the way they view – and approach – gun combat. Some things to note are:

- Gun combat is dangerous!
- On the whole people prioritise not being shot over shooting others
- The most common method of protection is to take covercover.
- Suppressing fire is the best way of preventing foes shooting backback.
- Firearms are surprisingly inaccurate unless time is taken to brace and/or aimaim.
- When you are shot, bad stuff happenshappens.

Defending oneself against gunfire largely becomes a matter of body armor, using cover, and trying to prevent the opponent from being able to fire back. As a consequenceConsequently, most gun battles tend to become very tactical – lots of suppressing fire, flanking movementmovement, and flushing foes from deep cover – during which characters may pass entire combat rounds being pinned down and unable to respond until the opposition stops firing... which some players may find extremely tedious.

It is perfectly possible that an entire gunfight will result in no injuries; just one side giving up due to running out of ammunition or fleeing the battle entirely. After all, few people want to risk being riddled with a burst from a weapon on full automatic.

Throughout these combat rules, certain action types, Special Effects and situations apply to combat with firearms only, and these are marked accordingly.

## Combat Rounds and Initiative

Combat Rounds use several important terms:

**Initiative** : The order of who acts when during a Turn of a Combat Round. The Games Master counts down through Initiative values from the highest to the lowest, so that each participant has a chance to take their Turn when their number is reached.

**Turns** : During each 5 second Combat Round, each participant has an opportunity to take one or more Turns, dependent on the number of Action Points they possess, and how they use them. Upon their Turn, participants perform one Combat Action, which comprises of a declaration, possible movement, any necessary dice rolls (including Reactions), and the resolution of the Action. If any participant has Action Points remaining, the players may each take another Turn in Initiative order. Once no Action Points remain, or any remaining are being held back for Reactions, play proceeds to the next Combat Round.

Each term is described in more detail, below.

### Initiative

Initiative determines participants' order of actions in a Combat Round. It is rolled at the start of a fight and determines when each character acts. Unless something occurs to change the situation, such as certain Combat Actions or Special Effects, Initiative remains in play until it is forced to be re-rolled.

Initiative is calculated by each participant rolling 1d10 and adding their Initiative Modifier. Whoever gained the highest result acts first, followed by the second highest and so on. When two or more participants tie scores, the one with the higher DEX will act first. If this still results in a tie, have each roll a die with high roll going before the other.

### Actions in Combat

Once Initiative has been determined, the participants have the potential to perform several Combat Actions during each Combat Round. All characters get 2 Action Points per Round, but when they can act is limited to whether the Action is proactive or Reactive. Proactive Actions can only be attempted on the character's own Turn; that is to say, during his Initiative. Proactive Actions are those in which the character is the instigator, such as making an attack with a weapon.

Reactive Actions are those taken by a character to counter or resist an act made against them. Only one reaction attempt is permitted for each threat, an example would be trying to parry an attack.

Unused Action Points do not carry over from one Round to the next.

## Combat Actions

Combat Actions are those acts which can be performed during battle. Drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or diving clear from an attack are all examples of Combat Actions. Most are concerned with elements of combat itself, but some relate to activities outside the realm of spells and weapons.

As previously mentioned, how often a character can act per Round is limited by their available Action Points. These are spent over the course of each Combat Round to perform various Combat Actions. Once a combatant's Action Points are expended, they may no longer act for the remainder of that Round and must wait until their points reset at the beginning of the next.

Unless otherwise specified any Combat Action (save for "Free" Actions) costs one Action Point. Thus, combatants need to carefully consider how and when they use their Action Points. They may act as aggressively or defensively as they wish, dynamically reacting to the evolving circumstance of the combat.

### Proactive Actions

The following are activities a character can attempt on his Turn by spending an Action Point. Note that some Actions such as spell casting or reloading may take several Turns to complete; each Turn costing its own Action Point.

#### Attack

The character can attempt to strike with a hand-to-hand weapon or use a Ranged Weapon.

#### Brace

The character braces by taking a firm stance and leaning into the direction of a forthcoming attack. For the purposes of resisting Knockback or Leaping Attacks, the character's SIZ is treated as 50% bigger. Against the Bash Special Effect, SIZ is doubled.

#### Cast Magic/Use Power

The character can attempt to cast a spell, invoke certain powers, and so on. Complex magics may require several Actions to complete the casting. Once concluded, the magic can be released at any moment up until the caster's next Turn – at which point it can be held for later effect, but this requires the Hold Magic/Power Action (see below) to maintain it in preparation for later release.

#### Change Range

The character can attempt to close in on or retreat from an opponent, as long as they are not engaged in hand to handhand-to-hand combat with the opponent, oropponent or being pinned-downpinned down by enemy fire in ranged combat situation.

#### Charge

The Charge Action allows a character to move into engagement range at running or sprinting speed, using the momentum of the charge to make a more forceful melee attack. Charging is covered on page XX.

#### Delay

The character conserves one or more Actions in order toto perform Reactive Actions later, such as Interrupt or Parry. The Action Point costs of delaying is covered by whatever acts are finally performed. If the delayed Actions are not taken before the character's Turn in the next Round, then the character is considered to have Dithered (see below)), and the Action Points are lost.

#### Dither

The default option unless another Action is chosen, the character simply wastes his turn doing nothing useful.

#### Hold Magic/Power

Once casting is complete, the character may hold a spell or Power in temporary check, awaiting the best moment to release it. The magic may be held back for as long as the character continues to take this Action on subsequent Turns, but this allows free use of the Counter Spell reaction by an enemy if pertinent to the spell. The actual skill roll to cast the held spell is not made until it is cast.

#### Mount

The character can mount or dismount a riding beast or vehicle. Particularly large mounts may require several Turns to complete.

#### Move

Move: Provided one is not engaged with an opponent, the character can move any distance the Games Master deems suitable for the situation.

#### Outmanoeuvre

The character can engage multiple opponents in a group Opposed Roll of Evade skills. Those who Fail to beat his roll cannot attack him in that Combat Round. See the section on Outmanoeuvring on page XX.

#### Ready Weapon

The character may retrieve, draw, sheath, withdraw, or reload a weapon or other object. Retrieving a nearby dropped object requires 2 Actions: one to move and reach down for the object and a second to return to a readied stance. Some missile weapons require several Actions to reload.

#### Reload (Firearms)

As per Ready Weapon. Reloading times can vary wildly according to the type of weapon. Single shot black powder muskets will be far slower to reload than changing an ammunition magazine or power source.

#### Regain Footing

If unengaged with an opponent, the character can automatically regain his footing from being tripped or knocked down. If Engaged, the character must win an Opposed Roll of Brawn or Athletics with the opponent before standing. This contest does not cost any Action Points to resolve.

#### Sneak Peek (Firearms)

Sneak Peek allows somebody currently sheltering behind cover to take a quick look-see to judge what the tactical situation is. The action is ostensibly safe, permitting the observer a single Perception roll before ducking back into cover. If the Perception test is a fumble however, they foolishly overextend their head or remain in sight long enough for an enemy to take a pot shot.

#### Steady Weapon (Firearms)

Allows the character to establish a firm firing posture and support an automatic weapon so that it remains stable. It requires that the character be at least partially exposed and not completely protected by cover. The primary benefit is that it reduces the recoil penalty of Burst or Full-Automatic fire by one step. This effect is similar tolike Brace in that its benefits continue until the character moves.

#### Struggle

If the character is the victim of certain types of attack or Special Effects, they may attempt to extract themself from the situation. For example, breaking free from an enemy's grip.

#### Switch Fire Mode (Firearms)

Switch Fire allows the user of an automatic or dual-purpose firearm to change the selector on their weapon to take advantage of other fire modes. Thus, an assault rifle could be switched from semi-automatic to burst, choose different types of ammunition, or a supplementary system such as an integral grenade launcher brought on lineonline. Whilst modern weapons require an Action Point on the character's Turn to switch modes, sufficiently advanced high-tech firearms may permit it as a Free Action, triggered by electronic implants or psychically reading the user's mind.

#### Take Cover

Take Cover is a proactive action which allows a shooter to duck behind whatever cover is available in their immediate vicinity, thereby gaining some degree of protection against incoming fire. Unlike Evade it does not leave the user prone but does rely on some form of cover being available, for example ducking back around a corner in a corridor or crouching down behind a table in a bar. Depending on circumstances, the available cover may or may not be sufficient to completely protect the character. The type of cover will also determine its protective qualities; a thick steel door for instance may prove impenetrable to bullets, whereas a thin wooden wall might only provide 4 Armor Points. For general guidelines concerning the protective qualities of certain materials, see the 'Inanimate Objects Armor and Hit Points' table on page XX.

### Reactive Actions

This list specifies Reactions that can be used at any time during the Combat Round as a response to an imminent threat. As in the previous list, a reaction costs an Action Point to perform.

#### Counter Spell

The character can attempt to dismiss or counter an incoming spell. This assumes the countering magic has a Casting Time of one Turn, otherwise it must be prepared in advance and temporarily withheld using the Hold Magic Action. Successfully intercepting magic in this manner is assumed to negate the entire spell, even those with multiple targets or areas of effect.

#### Evade

The character can use their Evade skill in an attempt to dive clear of threats such as incoming missiles or a charging attack. This leaves the character prone unless mitigated by an Ability or special circumstance. Thus, the character's next turn is usually spent taking the Regain Footing Action to stand again.

#### Interrupt

Delaying characters only. This Reactive Action halts an opponent's Turn at any point to take a delayed Turn Action. Assuming no change in the tactical situation, the opponent continues the Turn after the character's is completed. If unable to still achieve the original declaration, the opponent's Action Point is wasted. An interrupt can also be used to perform an attack-of-opportunity against anyone passing close by the delaying character and within weapon's reach.

#### Parry

The character can attempt to defend against an incoming attack using a combination of parrying, leaning, ducking, and sidestepping footwork to minimise the blow.

### Free Actions

Free Actions (listed below) can be performed at any time during the Combat Round and cost no Action Points to perform.

#### Assess Situation

If unengaged, a character can make a Perception roll at no Action Point cost. A Success reveals any relevant changes in the tactical situation (such as spotting a foe beginning a charge). Assessing while Running results in a Hard Perception roll, Sprinting is Formidable.

#### Drop Item

Dropping an item is a Free Action.

#### Signal

If unengaged, gesturing or signalling to one or more participants (if they can perceive the sign) is a Free Action.

#### Speak

A character can speak at any time during combat, but what is said should be limited to short phrases which can be uttered in five seconds or less; for example, 'Look out behind you!' or 'Damn you to hell!'

#### Use Luck Point

Using a Luck Point – to re-roll a particular result for example – is a Free Action.

#### Ward Location

The character guards a particular Hit Location from being hit by dedicating one of his weapons to passively block the area. Any blow which lands on that location has its damage automatically downgraded as per normal for a parrying weapon of its Size. The cover continues until the dedicated weapon is used to attack or actively Parry. Establishing or changing the Hit Location covered must be performed prior to an opponent rolling to attack the character. Due to their design, shields can cover multiple areas.

For further explanation see Passive Blocking in the Combat section.

## Movement

The following rules govern engagement in combat:

- Movement is performed by either the Move or Charge Action.
- The Move Action allows the character to move a distance equal to their Base Movement Rate.
- Movement can only be performed by unengaged characters (save for special cases such as Outmanoeuvring).
- Except in certain cases (such as charging), all significant movement ceases once a character enters the engagement range of the intended opponent.
- Unless charging through contact ,contact, moving into the opponent's engagement zone places each in engagement with the other.
- Once Engaged, characters cannot move away from an opponent unless first Withdrawing from close combat.
- Attempting to move past an unengaged foe who is using the Delay Combat Action, permits (as a specific exception) that opponent to strike at moving characters as they pass by or block a character's progress, prompting close combat on the following Turn or Round.

### Situational Movement Rates

These movement rates are situational and are not always an option. Many are detailed elsewhere but are included here for convenience. Most of these situational rates may be used in addition to a normal Movement Rate under set restrictions. Such information is detailed in the specific descriptions below.

#### Climb

A character that moves adjacent to or starts the Turn next to a climbable surface or object may climb at a rate equal to the Base Movement Rate. The character cannot have moved faster than a Walk and must have movement remaining, with the distance climbed being reduced by any movement already used. Worn armor hinders climbers by an amount equal to the Armor Points of the heaviest item worn.

#### Crawl

A character that begins the Turn prone may crawl at a maximum rate of two metres per Turn in place of a normal Move. Creatures that naturally crawl as their normal mode of movement instead use the rules for Walk, Run, and Sprint set forth above.

#### Jump

A character that moves adjacent to or starts the Turn next to a jumpable obstacle may attempt to leap over it. The character may be moving at any rate up to the point of the leap. A successful Athletics roll allows one to jump up to twice one's own height horizontally or up to half one's own height vertically (if the character has at least a five metrefive-metre run-up available). If jumping from a standing position, then these distances are halved.

#### Swim

A character that moves adjacent to or starts the Turn next to a body of water may swim at a rate equal to the Base Movement Rate, minus any movement already used. See the Swim skill description in Chapter XX for more information.

## How Combat Works

Fighting in _Mythras Imperative_ is resolved with each attack or parry representing a single stab, swing, spell cast, or shot of a weapon. Any offensive Action permits the chance to be resisted by a reaction. Thus, even if a character manages to strike an opponent, the foe is permitted their own roll to see if they can parry the blow before it lands. The same philosophy is used whether the attacks are missile weapons against targets diving for cover or trying to break free from the iron grasp of a giant octopus.

### Attacks and Parries

Close combat is handled in the following step-by-step manner:

1. On his turn the attacker spends an Action Point, rolls against his Combat Skill, and notes the result.
2. If desired, the defender spends an Action Point to Parry, rolls against his Combat Skill, and notes the result.
3. The success level of the results areis compared as per a Differential Roll .Roll.
4. Any difference grants the successful combatant with the superior roll one or more Special Effects.
5. If the attacker achieved a Success or Critical, they may roll weapon damage and apply their Damage Modifier (if any). If applicable, a Hit Location is determined for the blow.
6. If the defender achieved a Success or Critical, reduce any damage inflicted according to the comparative sizes of the weapons involved.
7. Reduce any remaining damage by the Armor Points of natural or worn protection.

Note that any Special Effects generated by the exchange are independent of whether damage is inflicted. It is quite possible for a defender to gain the higher success level, yet still suffer injury.

### Weapon Size

Every weapon in _Mythras Imperative_ possesses several different attributes from the damage it deals to how many hands are required to wield it. Size is a combination of a weapon's mass, leverage, and stability, and is used to determine the weapon's ability to impose and parry damage. Size categories are Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Enormous. The unarmed attacks of creatures are assigned similar categories according to their physical characteristics.

### Damage Reduction

If a defender succeeds in parrying, then they can reduce an attacker's damage, if any, according to the comparative Size of the weapons used.

- Parrying an attack with a weapon or shield of equal or greater Size deflects all damagedamage.
- Parrying with a weapon or shield of one Size less only deflects half damagedamage.
- Parrying with a weapon or shield two or more Sizes less fails to deflect any damagedamage.

_For example, parrying a great axe (Huge) with a kite shield (also Huge) would block all damage; parrying it with a Longsword (Large) would halve the damage, and parrying it with a shortsword (Medium) would stop no damage at all._

### Armor

Any damage which penetrates the defender's Parry is further reduced by the Armor Points of any natural protection (such as scales or a shell) or worn armor they possess. If the defender has both, then the two stack together to reduce damage.

Due to its mass and restriction to movement, the highest Armor Point value of armor worn by a character acts as a penalty to their Initiative roll.

### Parrying a Missed Attack

If the attacker misses his initial attack roll, the defender has the option to spend an Action Point to Parry. Although it may seem disingenuous to parry an attack which will miss anyway, a skilled defender can use this to his advantage to gain one or more Special Effects, potentially weakening or incapacitating a foe and preserving their next turn for some other Action.

#### Unable or Unwilling to Parry

In a situation where a defender is unable to Parry due to having no Action Points remaining, or, confident in his ability to weather the blow, elects not to Parry, they are treated as having automatically rolled a Failure. This has the consequence of granting a successful attacker one or more Special Effects.

### Unsuccessful Rolls and Fumbles

If both combatants Fail their rolls, or the defender decides not to take advantage of a missed attack, then the attack – Parry sequence ends, and combat continues on to the participant with the next highest Initiative.

## Special Effects

Fighting is far more than simply injuring or killing an opponent. Combative arts teach many methods of defeating a foe, perhaps rendering them helpless or forcing them into situations where they must capitulate, without necessarily needing to cause them harm. Special Effects represent these techniques and control how they occur in play.

Whenever opponents engage in a Differential Roll of their respective fighting skills, any resulting difference in success levels indicates an opportunity for Special Effects to occur. This reflects one combatant manoeuvring his opponent into a disadvantageous situation which can be exploited using a cunning trick or tactic.

The number of Special Effects received depends on the difference between the Levels of Success, as illustrated on the Differential Levels of Success table .table.

If any Special Effects are won during an exchange, they must be selected before Damage and Hit Location, if any, are rolled. In cases where the recipient is badly wounded in addition to receiving a Special Effect, Endurance rolls are resolved after the application of the effect.

Special Effects cover a diverse range of situations and techniques. Some are designed specifically for attacks, while others are intended for defence defense, and a few are adaptable for either circumstance. Certain Special Effects can also be limited to specific weapon types or specific dice rolls, requiring a Critical or Fumble result on their skill check for instance.

When two or more Special Effects are gained, the combatant may freely mix and match which ones are selected, providing the prerequisite conditions for each one are met. Some effects can be stacked. For example, an attacker who rolls a Critical Success and wins two Special Effects could choose Maximise Damage twice rather than choosing two separate offensive manoeuvres.

### Special Effect Descriptions

**Accidental Injury** : The defender deflects or twists an opponent's attack in such a way that the attacker fumbles, injuring themself. The attacker must roll damage against himself in a random Hit Location using the weapon used to strike. If unarmed, the attacker tears or breaks something internal, the damage roll ignoring any armor.

**Arise** : Allows the defender to use a momentary opening to roll back up to their feet.

**Bash** : The attacker deliberately bashes the opponent off balance. How far the defender totters back or sideward depends on the weapon being used. Shields knock an opponent back one metre for every 2 points of damage rolled (prior to any subtractions due to armor, parries, and so forth), whereas bludgeoning weapons knock back one metre for every three points. Bashing works only on creatures up to twice the attacker's SIZ. If the recipient is forced backward into an obstacle, then they must make a Hard Athletics or Acrobatics skill roll to avoid falling or tripping over. For firearms, since Bash relies more on catching an opponent off balance, rather than throwing them backwards by pure force, it is perfectly reasonable for projectile ammunition to cause a target to stagger if it strikes an extremity. Energy weapons are less likely to inflict such an effect unless the physics of the beam result in some sort of surface explosion.

**Bleed** : The attack cuts open a major blood vessel. If the blow overcomes Armor Points and injures the target, the defender must make an Opposed Roll of Endurance against the original attack roll. If the defender Fails, then they begin to bleed profusely. At the start of each Combat Round, the recipient loses one level of Fatigue, until they collapse and possibly die. Bleeding wounds can be staunched by passing a First Aid skill roll, but the recipient can no longer perform any strenuous or violent action without re-opening the wound. See Blood Loss, in the Game System section. For firearms, since most firearms produce very narrow wound paths, it is actually moremore difficult to nick or sever a major blood vessel than it is with a slicing or stabbing weapon. Due to this Bleed should be a Critical Success only – unless the gun is some sort of weird weaponry which fires shuriken, razor fléchettes, flattened force fields or some such exotic ammunition.

**Blind Opponent** : On a Critical the defender briefly blinds his opponent by throwing sand, reflecting sunlight off his shield, or some other tactic that briefly interferes with the attacker's vision. The attacker must make an Opposed Roll of his Evade skill (or Weapon skill if using a shield) against the defender's original Parry roll. If the attacker Fails, they suffer a situational modifier of Hard or Formidable for the next 1d3 Turns, depending on the method of blinding.

**Bypass armor** : On a Critical the attacker finds a gap in the defender's natural or worn armor. If the defender is wearing armor above natural protection, then the attacker must decide which of the two is bypassed. This effect can be stacked to bypass both. For the purposes of this effect, physical protection gained from magic is considered as being worn armor. Although Bypass Armor can ostensibly be used with any sort of attack, some types of ammunition might either be prevented from accessing this effect (shot gun pellets due to their spread) or built into their base performance, granting it as a bonus special effect in addition to any others won (Teleportation rounds). Much depends on how the Game Master wishes to model the weapon.

**Choose Location** : When using hand-to-hand melee weapons the attacker may freely select the location where the blow lands, as long as that location is normally within reach. If using Ranged Weapons Choose Location is a Critical Success only, unless the target is within Close Range and is either stationary or unaware of the attacker. For firearms, as per the default rules, Choose Location should be restricted to being a Critical Success only, unless the target is within close range and is either stationary or unaware of the impending attack. Telescopic scopes may extend this range.

**Circumvent Parry:** On a Critical the attacker may completely bypass an otherwise successful Parry.

**Damage Weapon** : Permits the character to damage his opponent's weapon as part of an Attack or Parry. If attacking, the character aims specifically at the defender's Parrying weapon and applies his damage roll to it, rather than the wielder. The targeted weapon uses its own Armor Points for resisting the damage. If reduced to zero Hit Points the weapon breaks. For firearms, since striking a handheld weapon at range is even more difficult than targeting a specific body location, this should generally be reserved for Critical Successes only. There are several exceptions however, the first being that a shield should, by its very nature, be much easier to hit. The second concerns exotic weapons which fire a cone shaped beam able to target handheld objects within its area of affect; for instance, an induction gun that heats metal objects.

**Disarm Opponent** : The character knocks, yanks, or twists the opponent's weapon out of his hand. The opponent must make an Opposed Roll of his Combat Style against the character's original roll. If the recipient of the disarm loses, his weapon is flung a distance equal to the roll of the disarmer's Damage Modifier in metres. If there is no Damage Modifier, then the weapon drops at the disarmed person's feet. The comparative size of the weapons affects the roll. Each step that the disarming character's weapon is larger increases the difficulty of the opponent's roll by one grade. Conversely, each step the disarming character's weapon is smaller makes the difficulty one grade easier. Disarming works only on creatures of up to twice the attacker's STR.

**Drop Foe:** Offensive, Firearms Only. Assuming the target suffers at least a minor wound from the shot, they are forced to make an Opposed Test of their Endurance against the attacker's hit roll. Failure indicates that the target succumbs to shock and pain, becoming incapacitated and unable to continue fighting. Recovery from incapacitation can be performed with a successful First Aid check or using some form of technological or narcotic booster if such exists in the campaign. OtherwiseOtherwise, the temporary incapacitation lasts for a period equal to one hour divided by the Healing Rate of the target.

**Duck Back:** Offensive, Firearms Only. This special effect allows the shooter to immediately duck back into cover, without needing to wait for their next Turn to use the Take Cover action. The character must be already standing or crouching adjacent to some form of cover to use Duck Back.

**Enhance Parry** : On a Critical the defender manages to deflect the entire force of an attack, no matter the Size of his weapon.

**Entangle** : Allows a character wielding an entangling weapon, such as a whip or net, to immobilise the location struck. An entangled arm cannot use whatever it is holding; a snared leg prevents the target from moving; while an enmeshed head, chest, or abdomen makes all skill rolls one grade harder. On his following turn, the wielder may spend an Action Point to make an automatic Trip Opponent attempt. An entangled victim can attempt to free himself on his turn by either attempting an Opposed Roll using Brawn to yank free, or win a Special Effect and select Damage Weapon, Disarm Opponent, or Slip Free.

**Force Failure** : Used when an opponent Fumbles, the character can combine Force Failure with any other Special Effect which requires an Opposed Roll to work. Force Failure causes the opponent to Fail his resistance roll by default – thereby automatically be disarmed, tripped, and so forth.

**Grip** : Provided the opponent is within the attacker's Unarmed Combat reach, they may use an empty hand (or similar limb capable of gripping) to hold onto the opponent, preventing them from being able to disengage from combat. The opponent may attempt to break free on his turn, requiring an Opposed Roll of either Brawn or Unarmed against whichever of the two skills the gripper prefers.

**Impale** : Roll weapon damage twice, with the attacker choosing which of the two results to use for the attack. Assuming the weapon is a melee weapon, if armor is penetrated and causes a wound, the attacker has the option of leaving the weapon in the wound or yanking it free on their next turn. Leaving the weapon in the wound inflicts a Difficulty Grade on the victim's future skill attempts. The severity of the penalty depends on the size of both the creature and the weapon impaling it, as listed on the Impale Effects Table below. For simplicity's sake, further impalements with the same sized weapon inflict no additional penalties. To withdraw an impaled weapon during melee requires use of the Ready Weapon Combat Action. The wielder must pass an unopposed Brawn roll (or win an Opposed Brawn roll if the opponent resists). Success pulls the weapon free, causing further injury to the same location equal to half the normal damage roll for that weapon, but without any Damage Modifier. Failure implies that the weapon remains stuck in the wound with no further effect, although the wielder may try again on their next turn. Specifically barbed weapons (such as harpoons) inflict normal damage. armor does not reduce withdrawal damage. While it remains impaled, the attacker cannot use his impaling weapon for Parrying.

**Impale Effects Table**

| Creature SIZ | Small Weapons | Medium Weapons | Large Weapons | Huge Weapons | Enormous Weapons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 | Formidable | Herculean | Incapacitated | Incapacitated | Incapacitated |
| 11-20 | Hard | Formidable | Herculean | Incapacitated | Incapacitated |
| 21-30 | No Effect | Hard | Formidable | Herculean | Incapacitated |
| 31-40 | No Effect | No Effect | Hard | Formidable | Herculean |
| 41-50 | No Effect | No Effect | No Effect | Hard | Formidable |
| Each +10 | Follow table progression |

For firearms, the ammunition of most projectile-based firearms will be able to impale. Game Masters may wish to restrict or ban this effect for plasma or laser basedlaser-based energy weapons. Bullets, fléchettes and similar projectiles are clearly too small to impose any secondary impaling effects.

**Marksman** : Permits the shooter to move the Hit Location struck by his shot by one step, to an immediately adjoining body area. Physiology has an effect oninfluences what can be re-targeted and common sense should be applied. Thus, using this Special Effect on a humanoid would permit an attacker who rolled a leg shot, to move it up to the abdomen instead. Conversely shooting a griffin in the chest would permit selection of the forelegs, wings, or head.

**Maximise**** Damage**: On a Critical the character may substitute one of his weapon's damage dice for its full value. For example, a Hand Axe which normally does 1d6 damage would instead be treated as a 6, whereas a great club with 2d6 damage would instead inflict 1d6+6 damage. This Special Effect may be stacked. Although it can also be used for natural weapons, Maximise Damage does not affect the Damage Modifier of the attacker, which must be rolled normally.

**Over-penetration:** Critical, Firearms Only. If shooting at lineally positioned opponents or into a densely packed group, this special effect allows the shot to travel completely through the first victim to strike a second behind them, assuming thatif it overcomes the first target's body armor. The second victimvictim, however, only suffers half damage due to attenuation or slowing down of the shot. Over-penetration is generally of more use with high powered weapons that inflict large amounts of damage or those which have some sort of armor piercing ability. Any special effects inflicted on the first target are not applied to the second.

**Pin Down:** Firearms Only. Similar toLike Press Advantage, this special effect forces the target to make an Opposed Test of their Willpower against the attacker's hit roll. Failure means that the target hunkers down behind whatever cover is available and cannot return fire on their next Turn. Note that Pin Down works even if no actual damage is inflicted on the target (perhaps due to a successful evasion or shots striking their cover instead), as it relies on the intimidation effect of gunfire passing very close by.

Although a pinned victim is unable to fire back for the requisite time, they can perform other actions provided they don't expose themselves to fire in the process, such as crawling away to new cover, communicating with others, reloading a weapon and so on.

**Prepare**** Counter**: The defender reads the patterns of his foe and prepares a counter against a specific Special Effect (which should be noted down in secret). If his opponent attempts to inflict the chosen Special Effect upon him during the fight, the defender instantly substitutes the attacker's effect with one of his own, which succeeds automatically.

**Rapid**** Reload**: When using a Ranged Weapon, the attacker reduces the reload time for the next shot by one. This effect can be stacked. For firearms, whilst useful for black powder or single round firearms, this effect has less of an obvious application when applied to automatic weapons, where the next shot is chambered (or charged) instantly. However, Rapid Reload could be used instead to quickly change weapon magazines. It might also be applicable for energy weapons that possess lengthy cycle times to recharge capacitors or allow the barrel to cool.

**Scar**** Foe**: The combatant inflicts his opponent with a scar that will be the talk of all for the rest of his or her life – such as an almost-severed-throat, or the letter 'Z' artfully inscribed across the chest.

**Select**** Target**: When an attacker Fumbles, the defender may manoeuvre or deflect the blow in such a way that it hits an adjacent bystander instead. This requires that the new target is within reach of the attacker's close combat weapon, or in the case of a ranged attack, is standing along the line of fire. The new victim is taken completely by surprise by the unexpected accident and has no chance to avoid the attack which automatically hits. In compensation, however, they suffer no Special Effect.

**Slip**** Free**: On a Critical the defender can automatically escape being Entangled, Gripped, or Pinned.

**Stun**** Location**: The attacker can use a bludgeoning weapon to temporarily stun the body part struck. If the blow overcomes Armor Points and injures the target, the defender must make an Opposed Roll of Endurance vs. the original attack roll. If the defender Fails, then the Hit Location is Incapacitated for a number of Turns equal to the damage inflicted. A blow to the torso causes the defender to stagger winded, only able to defend. A head shot renders the foe briefly insensible and unable to act.

**Sunder** : The attacker may use a suitable weapon, such as an axe, to damage the armor or natural protection of an opponent. Any weapon damage, after reductions for parrying or magic, is applied against the armor Point value of the protection. Surplus damage over its Armor Points is then used to reduce the Armor Point value of that armor(ed) location – ripping straps, bursting rings, creasing plates, or tearing away the hide, scales, or chitin of monsters. If any damage remains after the protection has been reduced to zero AP, it carries over onto the Hit Points of the location struck. For firearms, Sunder would be suitable for energy-based firearms designed to destroy ablative armors or more exotic concepts like gravity wave guns.

**Trip**** Opponent**: The character attempts to overbalance or throw his opponent to the ground. The opponent must make an Opposed Roll of his Brawn, Evade, or Acrobatics against the character's original roll. If the target Fails, they fall prone. Quadruped opponents (or creatures with even more legs) may substitute their Athletics skill for Evade and treat the roll as one Difficulty Grade easier. For firearms, assuming the firearm actually shootsshoots ammunition with mass, there is no reason that this effect couldn't be used when shooting at the legs of an opponent, even if no damage penetrates any worn protection.

**Weapon Malfunction:** Attacker Fumbles, Firearms Only. The attacker's firearm malfunctions in such a way that it is rendered useless until time can be spent field stripping and cleaning it.

**Withdraw** : The defender may automatically withdraw out of reach, breaking off engagement with that particular opponent.

## Close Combat

Close combat is hand-to-hand fighting in its classic sense when combatants strike each other with wielded or natural weapons. The following guidelines offer ways to make close combat more interesting and help to further explain some concepts hinted at earlier in this chapter.

### Situational Modifiers

Situational modifiers may be applied when fighting in particular conditions, or as the result of a Special Effect. For example, fighting in the dark might incur a Difficulty Grade of Herculean. Unless stated otherwise, modifiers are decided by the Games Master. Where two or more situations are pertinent to the character, use the most severe.

Some modifiers are circumstance dependent, but rather than applying a Difficulty Grade the Combat Skill is limited by a relevant skill. For example, fighting from the back of a horse would cap the combatant's Combat Skill by their Ride skill, while fighting in water might cap it to the value of the character's Swim.

**Close Combat Situational Modifiers**

| Situation | Difficulty Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Attacking a helpless target | Automatic |
| Attacking in a confined situation | Hard |
| Defending while on lower ground or against mounted foe | Hard |
| Fighting while on unstable ground | Hard |
| Fighting while crouching or from one knee | Hard |
| Fighting in poor visibility (thick fog, snowstorm) | Hard |
| Defending against an attack from behind | Formidable |
| Fighting while prone | Formidable |
| Fighting in partial darkness (dim illumination) | Formidable |
| Fighting in pitch black conditions (no illumination at all) | Herculean |
| Blinded or loss of primary perceptive sense | Herculean |

### Engagement

A character is considered Engaged if within melee weapon range of an opponent. This does not necessarily require that both combatants can reach each other; only that one of them can be potentially struck by the other. Once a character has Engaged with an opponent, they can no longer freely depart that fight (charging past is a special exception). It requires some form of deliberate act to break contact with the foe, normally performed via a Combat Action such as Outmanoeuvre, or use of the Withdraw Special Effect.

### Charging

The Charge Action is the act of moving quickly to increase the force and impact of an attack. A charge requires the attacker to choose a Charge Action, moving at either a Running or Sprint gait. If this brings them into contact with their opponent, they must stop there and conduct the Attack Action, as modified for the charge. There is no minimum distance that must be covered before a charge can take place, as the distance moved is less a factor than the momentum achieved. Hence running or sprinting.

While charging, the attack roll suffers a Difficulty Grade of Hard. In return the charge increases the Size of the attacking weapon by one step and a bipedal attacker's Damage Modifier by one step;step, or two steps if a quadruped (or more legs). Riding characters may substitute their Damage Modifier for that of their mount instead. The final position of the charging character depends on the result of the exchange and whether the attacker wishes to stop or continue sweeping past, immediately breaking engagement.

Rather than Parrying or Evading, the recipient of a charge can simultaneously counterattack the charging attacker instead. In this case the wielder of the longer weapon strikes first. If the weapon can be set to receive a charge (such as a spear), the recipient may use the Damage Modifier of the charger instead of his own.

### Cover

Opponents use cover to obstruct attacks against them, by either physically blocking a blow due to the toughness of the interposing material, or by obscuring where precisely the foe is. The precise value of cover depends on the thickness of its protection and the extent of its coverage.

An attack against a target that lands on an obscured Hit Location will be blocked to the extent of the cover's inherent protection. Cover can be partially negated either by use of the Choose Location Special Effect to aim at visible parts of the target, ortarget or striking through the cover if the weapon is capable of penetratingcan penetrate it.

In situations where cover is total, but the attacker believes his attack will penetrate, they may strike blindly at the hidden target. In such cases, the attack roll is one grade harder, and Choose Location may not be taken if a Special Effect is won. This assumes the attacker knows fairly accurately the target's position behind the cover.

### Evading

Evading in combat is to throw oneself clear of an overwhelming attack. This requires an Opposed Roll of the Evade skill of the defender versus the attacker's pertinent roll. This could be anything from the Drive skill of a ramming battle tank to the spell casting skill of a magician. If the attacker winswins, then they inflict damage as per normal. If the defender wins, damage is completely avoided.

If the winner of the Opposed Roll achieves one or more Levels of Success over his opponent, they may select suitable Special Effects as per normal combat. Whatever the result, the evasive gambit leaves the defender prone – usually requiring the character to regain his footing on his following turn – unless they can use the Arise Special Effect.

### Knockback

An attack which imparts more damage than the SIZ of the recipient will, by default, result in the character being knocked back. The damage in this circumstance is before any reduction due to parrying or armor. On receiving such a blow, the recipient must pass an Easy Acrobatics or Standard Athletics roll to avoid falling prone. They are also thrust one metre for every five points of damage (or fraction thereof) over their SIZ. Proactively using the Brace Combat Action can reduce or even negate the effects of knockback.

### Leaping Attacks

Leaping attacks can be launched from a variety of situations, most are triggered as part of an ambush or at the conclusion of a charge, but some creatures can leap atop an opponent without the need for a run-up or superior height.

A leaping attack is resolved with an Opposed Roll of the leaper's Athletics skill versus the defender's Brawn or Evade skill. Quadruped targets make the attack roll one Difficulty Grade harder. If the leaper wins then the defender is automatically knocked prone, with the attacker astride them. Failure means the defender has weathered or sidestepped the impact. If the winner of the Opposed Roll achieves one or more Levels of Success over his opponent, they may select suitable Special Effects as per normal combat.

No damage is inflicted as part of the leap; however, a subsequently prone victim cannot recover his footing until either his attacker leaves, or they eventually win a Special Effect permitting them to Arise. In addition, leaping attacks only work against opponents of up to twice the attacker's SIZ. A target can make themselves more difficult to knock down by proactive use of the Brace Combat Action, provided they are aware of the impending leap attack.

### Outmanoeuvring

A character facing multiple opponents can use movement to limit the number which can attack him at any time, constantly shifting position, forcing foes to interfere with one another. Outmanoeuvring requires that the character has room to move about and is not pinned in a confining area.

Outmanoeuvring requires that the character engages his opponents in a group Opposed Roll of Evade skills. Every participant, both the manoeuvring character and those foes who wish to corner him, must spend an Action Point. Then they each roll once and those who fail to beat the manoeuvring character's roll cannot attack him for the remainder of that Combat Round, being blocked by their allies or terrain features.

If the manoeuvring character beats all of his opponents, one has the choice of safely engaging a single foe for the rest of the Round or Withdrawing from the fight completely.

### Passive Blocking

Passive Blocking allows a character armed with a weapon to hold it in such a way that it covers a chosen location (or locations when using a shield), but at the cost of being unable to actively Parry with it (see Ward Location). Any attack which hits the locations automatically receives the benefit of the weapon or shield, reducing damage as normal. The technique is commonly used when a warrior wishes to guard a weak spot or wounded location. Nothing prevents a dual weapon, or weapon and shield combatant from using his other weapon to actively parry.

Since Passive Blocking works in the same way as cover, the Choose Location Special Effect cannot be used to bypass the block in close combat, though opponents can still use the effect to strike other unblocked areas. Crouching down behind a shield allows a character to double the number of locations covered while Passive Blocking.

### Surprise

Surprise occurs when an unexpected attack is launched against opponents unaware of the attacker's presence or intention. An ambush would be an example of the former, while treacherously turning on an unsuspecting ally during amiable conversation illustrates the latter.

The effects of surprise on a target are potent:

- The target suffers a –10 penalty to InitiativeInitiative.
- Until their Initiative arrives, they are considered flat-footed and cannot defend themselvesthemselves.
- The first attack on the target, if successful, gains a bonus Special Effect
- For the remainder of the Round, they may not perform any offensive ActionAction.

### Sweep Attacks

Sweep attacks occur at the Games Master's decision, when weapons or creatures of unusual size attack a closely clumped group of opponents – the scything tail of a huge dragon or the unstoppable charge of a giant triceratops for example – striking several foes simultaneously.

A sweep attack is made by applying a single attack roll of the weapon or creature to all targets in its path. Each defender must resolve the effects of the attack separately and any Special Effects imposed on the attacker are treated as having occurred concurrently.

## Ranged Combat

Ranged combat incorporates all forms of weaponry which require to be shot, thrown, or slung to strike their target. Ranged attacks are resolved in an identical way to close combat. However, Ranged Weapons can normally only be parried with shields; those without must rely on natural cover or use Evade to dive out of the line of fire. Thus, against lightly armored foes, Ranged Weapons can be formidable deterrents.

Each Ranged Weapon has several specific attributes which determine its effectiveness. The ones which have a key bearing on combat are as follows:

#### Force

The Ranged Weapon equivalent of Size. It is an abstract measure of the penetrative power of a weapon or its ammunition to determine whether the blow overcomes a (shield) parry.

#### Damage Modifier

This Attribute shows whether or notwhether the Damage Modifier of the attacker can be used to boost the Ranged Weapon's damage roll. In general, only self-drawn bows and thrown weapons allow the user to apply their Damage Modifier.

#### Range

Three numbers separated by slashes, representing the maximum Close, Effective, and Long ranges of the weapon or its ammunition. Close Range is the distance over which the Choose Location Special Effect may be used, provided the target is stationary or unaware of the impending attack. Effective Range has no significant modifiers. At Long Range, the weapon can still inflict harm, but the amount of damage is halved, and Force is reduced by one step.

#### Load

The time in Turns taken to load or reload a weapon that fires ammunition. A character can reduce the time spent loading or readying by use of the Rapid Reload Special Effect.

#### Impale Size

The Size of an impaled weapon is different from the Force it strikes with. Ranged impaling weapons have a special column denoting their actual size when considering the hindrances caused by the Impale Special Effect.

### Situational Modifiers

As with close combat, situational modifiers may be applied when using Ranged Weapons in particular conditions. A character's Combat Skill may be capped when using the weapon in difficult circumstances, such as throwing a spear while riding a horse.

**Ranged Combat Situational Modifiers**

| Situation | Difficulty Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Light Wind\* | Hard |
| Moderate Wind\* | Formidable |
| Strong Wind\* | Herculean |
| Gale, Storm, or Worse\* | Hopeless |
| Target is Running | Hard |
| Target is Sprinting | Formidable |
| Target obscured by mist or is in partial darkness | Hard |
| Target obscured by thick smoke or is in darkness | Formidable |
| Target completely obscured | Herculean |
| Target completely invisible | Impossible\*\* |
| Target prone | Formidable |
| Attacker prone\*\*\* | Herculean |
| Attacker is on unstable ground | Hard |

\* Assumes the thrown weapon or ammunition is vulnerable to crosswinds, and supersedes the normal penalty imposed by the winds on normal skills.

\*\* Unless targets general location is revealed or known, then treat as Herculean

\*\*\* Penalty can be negated if using a crossbow or firearm from a prepared position.

### Aiming

By spending additional time aiming a Ranged Weapon, a character can potentially increase his chance of hitting. Aiming requires an entire Combat Round steadying the weapon and waiting for the best opportunity to release, for example withholding a bowshot for a momentary lull in the wind or until a target moves between two obstructions. By aiming, the character may reduce the difficulty of a Range or Situational Modifier by one grade. Additional Rounds spend aiming grant no further advantage.

### Automatic Fire

Some firearms automatically chamber the next shot, by using the waste gases, recoilrecoil, or energy from the previous shot. With no need to re-cock, this grants the weapon a range of different firing rates, all dependent on how much ammo the user wishes to release.

These firing modes are known as Semi-Automatic, Burst and Full-Automatic. Whilst this ability can make some guns capable of dealing out fearsome damage, trying to maintain accuracy with recoiling weapons is problematic. Assume that the following rules primarily apply to projectile firing automatic weapons.

#### Semi-Automatic

This is actually thethe default rate of fire for most guns, where each pull of the trigger fires a single shot and loads the next round.

#### Burst

For burst fire each pull on the trigger releases a short number of rounds, usually no more than three to five depending on the weapon. Its original purpose was to permit limited suppression fire, butfire but restrict excessive ammunition use. It is not intended to improve the shooter's chance to hit since rapid, sequential recoil continually jerks the weapon off-line. Firing in burst mode imposes a penalty grade of Hard to the attack roll. If the attack succeeds however, the shooter rolls a dice to see how many of the rounds in that burst struck home on the target. SoSo, a three round burst would use 1d3. Roll separate location and damage for each round which hits.

#### Full-Automatic

Normally used for full blown suppressing fire to pin down multiple targets, full-automatic can be devastating if fired into a closely grouped body of enemies. The shooter decides how many rounds of ammo to fire (up to the limit of the cyclic rate of the weapon) which are then evenly distributed across all the targets included in the arc of fire. Any spare rounds are considered lost whilst traversing aim (thus firing 15 rounds at 6 targets would be two bullets each). A separate attack roll is made for each target, but at a difficulty grade of Formidable due to the increased recoil effects of sustained fire. Those targets who are hit suffer a random number of rounds as per Burst Fire.

Note that only the first shot which strikes during a burst or full automatic spray can benefit from special effects. Thus, rolling a critical attack whilst firing in automatic mode would permit the selection of Maximise Damage, but only with the first shot, even if all the remaining rounds hit home.

**Why is Automatic Fire So Heavily PenalisedPenalized?**

It might appear that the rules for automatic fire are unduly harsh compared with the apparent accuracy of modern firearms. There are several reasons for this, the primary ones being streamlining and game balance. Players who criticisecriticize their character's inaccuracy should be reminded that any tweaks to the rules will be applied against them too;too, which given the lethality of rapid fire should be a sobering thought.

Of course, some of these recoil penalties can be mitigated, for example by using Steady Weapon to brace automatic firearms. The truth of the matter is though, that firefights are very different to target shooting on a gun range. The instinct to take cover when bullets are flying, the need to keep mobile and every shot taken pinpointing the shooter by its muzzle flash or sound, often prevents any chance of aiming or bracing. The phrase 'Spray and Pray' was coined for very good reason!

### Dual Firearms

Characters may use dual firearms, shooting both weapons simultaneously during their Turn to gain a more rapid rate of fire. However, this comes at a penalty to accuracy. Firing a pistol in each hand suffers a penalty of Hard to hit the target. Those trying to concurrently shoot with a carbine or SMG in each hand suffer a penalty of Formidable.

### Firing into a Crowd

Firing into the swirling ebb and flow of a melee can be a risky business, thus there is always a risk of accidentally striking someone other than the original target being aimed at. When firing at a specific target at the edge of a crowd or melee, the attack suffers a Difficulty Grade of Hard. If trying to fire through it should be raised to Formidable. Aiming is still permitted to help mitigate the danger.

A marksman who passes his attack roll despite the difficulty penalty has aimed true and will hit his intended target. IfIf, however, the marksman Fails the roll, but would have succeeded if not for the 'firing into a crowd' penalty, then an adjacent victim is struck instead (who is free to Evade or Parry as normal).

If more than one target is in the line of fire, the Games Master should determine the victim randomly. Any Special Effects won as part of the attack only apply to the original target, not any accidentally struck bystander.

### Fumbling with Firearms

Since gunfire is not normally resisted by an opposing skill, a special provision should be made when a shooter fumbles their attack roll. In this case, whomever was the intended target is allowed to select a fumble specific special effect, which the shooter then suffers. See also the fumble only Special Effect Weapon Malfunction.

### Parrying Weapon Fire with Shields

As expressed earlier, it is almost impossible to deliberately parry a supersonic projectile or energy beam. Shields however still provide a degree of protection since in effect they are portable 'cover'..' To utilise a shield in a fire-fightfirefight, just use the Passive Blocking rules on page XX.

With regard toRegarding more modern firearms or those of a science fiction nature, a Game Master may wish to grant the shield an Armor Point value rather than assigning it a Size, based upon the inherent material it is made from. For exampleexample, a wooden shield might be treated as 4 Armor Points, a Kevlar tactical shield 8 AP, and a Ulysses 31 bracelet force field shield 15 AP.

### Telescopic Sights

A telescopic sight improves the accuracy of a firearm over greater distances when the user takes the time to aim properly (see Aiming). The most basic telescopic sights are merely optical magnifiers, but as technology advancesadvances, they begin to incorporate integral rangefinders, projectile trajectory calculators, air movement sensors, atmospheric lensing compensators, IR or low light amplifiers and a host of other gadgets which improve its effective 'hit' distance.

Telescopic Sights make skill rolls easier by one or more Grades (see page 18), depending on the sophistication of the sight. No sight can make a skill roll an Automatic success, so the best Grade that can be attained is Very Easy.

## Vehicles

Vehicles in _Mythras Imperative_ are treated in a semi-abstract fashion. EssentiallyEssentially, they are background tools, used to get characters from A to B, with little need for detailed description or statistics. On occasion though, Games Masters will require details for vehicles when it is necessary to represent them in chases or combat situations.

The rules in this section allow for the representation of most kinds of vehicles but in an abstracted way that is intended to permit flexibility and enhance storytelling. Starships and space craft are a little different, although they are based on similar principles.

## Statistics

All vehicles are described in terms of their Structure, Hull, Speed, Systems, Traits, and Shields (if present in the setting).

Size: All vehicles have one of six Size ratings which determines the value or range of the rest of the characteristics. Due to their larger intrinsic size and the hostile environments of space, starships have their own range of values.

**Hull** : Represents Armor Points

**Structure** : Represents a vehicle's Hit Points

**Speed** : Every vehicle has a basic Speed rating

**Systems** : Representing vital components of the vehicle, including the power plant, crew section, and so on.

**Traits** : A vehicle may also have 1 or more Traits. Traits, like the Abilities assigned to Creatures in the _Mythras Imperative_ rules, or Combat Style Traits, offer an additional game description and advantage, reflecting the vehicle's nature.

**Shields** : In settings with advanced energy manipulation technology, shields may be present that protect the vehiclevehicle, but which may ablate under sustained fire.

**Vehicle Size Table**

| Size | System Hits |
| --- | --- |
| Small | 1 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Large | 3 |
| Huge | 4 |
| Enormous | 5 |
| Colossal | 6 |

## Hull and Structure

The size and purpose of a vehicle affects the thickness of its hull and resilience of its internal structure. A motorcycle, for example, has a minimal hull, built as it is for speed and agility. A Land Ironclad (a massive, tracked or wheeled armored behemoth, powered by steam or diesel engines), being a much larger vehicle designed for the battlefield, has a much larger hull. The comparative sizes of hulls (and how many hits from weapons they can typically withstand), is summarised on the Vehicle Size table below.

Whenever a vehicle suffers harm, the incoming damage is reduced by its Hull value. Any remaining damage is subtracted from the vehicle's Structure points and has a percentage chance (equal to the penetrating damage) of affecting a System. If the vehicle is ever reduced to zero Structure it is either utterly destroyeddestroyed, or so badly wrecked it must be scrapped.

**Terrestrial Hulls**

| **Size** | **Structure** | **Civilian Hull Value** | **Military Hull Value** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 1-20 | 1-3 | 4-6 | Motorcycle, motorcycle with sidecar, compact or subcompact car, canoe, kayak, rowboat |
| Medium | 21-40 | 1-6 | 7-9 | Sedan, panel van, pickup, luxury car, luxury sports car, muscle car, limousine, lifeboat, speedboat, hang glider, autogyro |
| Large | 41-60 | 4-9 | 10-12 | Lorry/truck, stretch limo, SUV, bus, people carrier, personal aircraft, glider, pleasure cruiser, tank, helicopter, submarine |
| Huge | 61-80 | 7-12 | 13-15 | Semi, airliner, jet, coastguard vessel, yacht |
| Enormous | 81-100 | 10-15 | 16-18 | Train, cruise liner, naval vessel |

**Starship Hulls**

| Size | Structure | Civilian Hull Value | Military Hull Value | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 10-50 | 4-9 | 10-12 | Single seat fighter |
| Medium | 51-150 | 7-12 | 13-15 | Light Freighter, Shuttle craft |
| Large | 151-450 | 10-15 | 16-18 | Heavy Freighter, Cruiser |
| Huge | 451-1350 | 13-18 | 19-21 | Escort Frigate, Light Battle Cruiser |
| Enormous | 1351-4050 | 16-21 | 21-24 | Generation Ship, Heavy Battle Cruiser |
| Colossal | 4050-12,110 | 19-24 | 24-30 | Orbital Habitat, Planet-Busting Battle Station |

## Speed

Since the physics of velocity, acceleration, drag and inertia (to name but a few) are complex issues, some simplification is needed and so vehicles are given an abstract speed rating. The Speed characteristic should only be used to roughly judge if one vehicle can overtake or catch up with another.

The speed rating represents a vehicle's nominal operational rate. In emergency situations this performance can be increased by one step, at risk of wear or damage to the engines. Although the same table is used for all vehicle types, common sense should be applied so that only vehicles of the same class are compared. For exampleexample, if a Starship and a sports car both have the same acceleration rate of Rapid, then it should be obvious the spaceship is comparatively faster.

Increasing a vehicle's Speed beyond its standard value is possible on a successful Drive roll. UsuallyUsually, this extra speed is only sustainable for a short period – no more than 1d6 minutes before the vehicle must drop to its standard speed or risk damage to its powerplant. A critical Drive roll allows the period of higher speed to be increased to 1d12 minutes.

A driver can attempt to push a vehicle's speed by 2 steps, but this requires a Herculean Drive roll and the maximum the vehicle can sustain this speed is 1d3 minutes: a Critical Success will not extend the increased speed's duration.

**Speed Rating Table**

| Speed Rating | Max Speed For |
| --- | --- |
| Ponderous | Enormous |
| Sluggish | |
| Slow | Huge |
| Mediocre | |
| Gentle | Large |
| Moderate | |
| Rapid | Medium |
| Fast | |
| Fleet | Small |

## Systems

Every time a vehicle suffers damage that penetrates its hull, there is a chance that a vital System has been affected. Depending on which system has been hit, the effects of System damage can be catastrophic.

The damage a System can sustain is based purely on the vehicle's size. This is modelled by the number of times it is hit, rather than the actual amount of damage. A single hit on a Small vehicle will instantly destroy that system. It takes two hits to demolish a Medium sized vehicle's subsystem, three for a Large vehicle, and so on. See the table on page XX.

Systems that are damaged, but not yet destroyed, suffer a loss in functionality. This is equal to the proportion of current hits to its total capability. Thus, an Enormous vehicle hit twice in the Drive would lose 40% of its power (2 hits out of a maximum of 5) and would reduce its Speed rating accordingly. For instance, a Land Ironclad with a Speed of Slow would be reduced to Ponderous. The specific effect depends on what the subsystem controls. See the tables on pages XX and XX.

## Traits

The maximum number of traits a vehicle can have depends on hull size and type.

Every vehicle has an inherent trait: the travel mode for which it was primarily designed. ThereforeTherefore, aircraft inherently hold the Airborne trait, boats the Seaborne trait, and so on., This inherent trait does not count towards the available number of traits. However, if a vehicle wishes to include a second travel mode — a flying submarine for instance, then the Airborne trait would need to be taken as part of its available traits.

Some traits may not be available, depending on the technology level of the setting; Games Masters must make their own judgement calls as to what traits can be applied.

**Vehicle Trait Allocation Table**

| Size | Max Traits |
| --- | --- |
| Small | 1 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Large | 3 |
| Huge | 4 |
| Enormous | 5 |
| Colossal | 6 |

#### Airborne

The vehicle is capable of atmospheric flight.

#### All Terrain

This Trait must be used with Ground vehicles. The vehicle is capable of traversingcan traverse inhospitable, difficultdifficult, and steep terrain, using either tracks, advanced suspension and drive systems, or powerful drive differentials.

#### Burrowing

The vehicle is designed to burrow and tunnel through the ground. It can achieve a maximum depth equal to its Hull Rating x5 metres.

#### Camouflaged

The vehicle possesses either camouflage paint or mimetic sensors that allow it to blend with its environment. Attempts to spot the vehicle visually are one grade more difficult.

#### Cargo

The vehicle is designed specifically to haul cargo rather than passengers. Passenger compartments are kept to a minimum with the rest of the vehicle's usable space being devoted to cargo containment with appropriate sections, tools, and even environmental conditioning (such as freezer sections for transporting perishables). When laden with cargo the vehicle's speed is two steps lower than its hull size would ordinarily allow.

#### Carrier

The vehicle is designed specifically to carry smaller, lightly crewedcrewed, or possibly remotely controlled vehicles of either a civilian or military nature. Any vehicle possessing this trait must be at least Enormous. The number of small craft carried may vary by mission type and purpose, butpurpose but can be as few as 10 to as many as the vehicle's Structure rating.

#### Construction

The vehicle is equipped for heavy construction work. All vehicles with this trait are have the All TerrainAll-Terrain Trait too, but speed is two steps lower than their hull size would ordinarily allow. The vehicle is fitted with task-appropriate tools such as crane jibs, digger shovels, dump carts and so on.

#### EMP Resistant

The vehicle is shielded against electromagnetic pulse attacks.

#### Enhanced Performance

Vehicle's Speed rating is one step higher than the maximum for its size.

#### Ejector Seat

In case of an emergency, an ejector seat propels occupants several hundred metres in the air, then deploys a parachute to allow a safe landing. Parachute is optional. Not recommended for helicopters (the Kamov Ka-52 Alligator being a notable exception).

#### FTL

Spacecraft Only. The craft is fitted with a faster than light engine (be this a hyperdrive, warp drive, wormhole generator or similar). The FTL drive has a separate Speed rating which essentially measures the rate at which a starship can cross a single parsec (3.26 light-years, or 31 trillion kilometres or 19 trillion miles), as follows:

**FTL Speed Rating Table**

| Speed Rating | Factor to Traverse 1 Parsec |
| --- | --- |
| Ponderous | 10 |
| Sluggish | 8 |
| Slow | 7 |
| Mediocre | 6 |
| Gentle | 5 |
| Moderate | 4 |
| Rapid | 3 |
| Fast | 2 |
| Fleet | 1 |

The factor time is for the Games Master to decide, depending on how advanced is the setting's FTL developmentthe setting's FTL development is. For example, the base factor might be 1 Day, meaning that a ship with a Ponderous FTL drive takes 10 days to complete the journey, whereas a vessel with a Fleet FTL drive completes the trip in 1 day. Elsewhere, where FTL technology is significantly less efficient, then the factor time might be measured in months, rather than days.

It is assumed that the ship has fuel reserves to either make a return journey, or a means to refuel at the destination point.

Assume that any size of starship can be fitted with an FTL drive, although, again, this depends on the setting.

FTL drives cannot be activated within 1.5 Astronomical Units of a star (around 225 million kilometres, or 270 million miles). This means ships must use a sublight drive to move to about the distance of Mars before activating the FTL system.

#### Ground Vehicle

The vehicle is capable of ground travel.

#### Hover

The vehicle hovers above the ground either using an air cushion or an anti-gravity repulsor.

#### Luxurious

The vehicle is designed specifically to carry passengers at a certain level of luxury. Excess cargo space is given over to luxurious passenger accommodations, swimming pools, hot tubs, extra crew to cater to the whims of the passengers, and so forth.

#### Rails

The vehicle relies on a rail system. Vehicles with this trait can naturally achieve a Speed rating three steps higher than their hull size would ordinarily allow, butallow but are obviously restricted to movement on the rail system only.

#### Resilient

All systems can withstand one additional hit more than normally determined by Size. This Trait can be stacked — so Resilient 2 indicates that systems can withstand 2 hits more than usual at a cost of two Trait points.

#### Seaborne

The vehicle is buoyant on water.

#### Spacecraft

The vehicle is sealed against vacuum and shielded against cosmic radiation and may, depending on design, be capable of leaving and re-entering atmosphere, and sustaining flight within an atmosphere.

#### Stealth

Aircraft Only. The vehicle is designed to avoid detection by radar and other long-range sensor systems. Attempts to spot the vehicle using electronic sensors are one grade more difficult.

#### Submersible

The vehicle is capable of submersing beneath the surface of an ocean to an operating depth of its Hull Rating x10 metres. The collapse depth — the absolute maximum the submersible can reach without being crushed — is 1.5 times its operating depth.

#### Superior Handling

The vehicle's handling is rated as Easy.

#### Surveillance Suite

The vehicle has an onboard computer, comms base station, receiver for listening device signals, and apparatus to intercept nearby smartphone signals within 100 metres.

#### Tough

A civilian vehicle with this trait draws its Hull from the Military column and automatically has the maximum Structure. A Military vehicle with this Trait draws its Hull and Structure from the next row down.

#### Tractor Beam

Spacecraft Only. The ship is fitted with a tractor beam that can ensnare and draw to it vehicles with a hull-rating of up to two steps less than its own. Thus, a Huge starship could attract and hold a hull of up to Medium size.

#### VTOL

Vertical takeoff/landing. This trait is inherent for helicopters and similar vehicles that use a combination of rotors to produce lift. When applied to fixed-wing aircraft it indicates the use of fixed or align-able thrusters to control airborne attitude, ascentascent, and descent.

#### Walker

The vehicle propels itself using articulated legs. Walker vehicles are capped at the Speed of Gentle, whatever their Size. However, Walkers can be built to heights that would simply be unstable for vehicles equipped with other means of locomotion.

#### Weaponised

The vehicle has been adapted to accommodate weaponry. Weapon systems are discussed on page XX.

## Handling and Manoeuvres

Evasive or sudden manoeuvres require a successful Drive/Pilot roll to ensure that the driver or pilot retains control of the vehicle. Most vehicles are designed and built to withstand occasional stresses and strains, but the Games Master may rule that a particular manoeuvre requires a roll at a higher grade of difficulty, depending on how ambitious it is. Failure means that control over the vehicle is lost: roll on the Loss of Control chart.

Note that the Loss of Control Table only applies to terrestrial vehicles. Similar effects can be applied to airborne and space vehicles, but Games Masters will need to adjust the reasoning for the specific effect. For example, an aircraft, rather than skidding, might go into a spin.

Also, a vehicle's inherent handling may have an additional impact on the Drive roll. Handling is either Easy, Standard, Hard, Formidable or Herculean and determines the starting point for the Drive roll when executing a manoeuvre. The difficulty grade for the manoeuvre is then applied to the handling to determine the final difficulty.

For example, a high performancehigh-performance motorcycle has in-built gyro-stabilisersgyrostabilisers giving it a Handling of Easy. The driver wants to perform a 180 degree180-degree skid-turn to evade a pursuer, a manoeuvre the Games Master rates as being one additional grade of difficulty. The rider must therefore make his Drive roll at Standard rather than Easy. If he had been attempting the same manoeuvre on a non-stabilised motorcycle, the Drive roll would be at Hard.

Superior Handling is a Trait. If a vehicle does not have the trait as part of its description, then the default is Standard handling for any vehicle of size Large and below. Huge and Enormous vehicles inherently have the Handling trait of Formidable and Herculean, respectively, and the Games Master is at liberty to rule that certain manoeuvres are simply impossible to achieve due to the vehicle's size.

**Loss of Control Table**

| 1d100 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01-25 | Swerve. The loss of control is temporary. Vehicle drops its speed by 1 step for 5 seconds. |
| 26-40 | Skid. Driver must fight to keep the vehicle under control. Vehicle drops its speed by 2 steps for 10 seconds. |
| 41-50 | Severe Skid. Vehicle ends-up facing in the wrong direction and at a standstill for 15 seconds. |
| 51-60 | Roll. Vehicle skids and rolls, sustaining 3d10 damage to its Structure. Occupants must make successful Endurance rolls or sustain 1d10 damage to 1d3 Hit Locations. |
| 61-70 | Severe Roll. As above, but vehicle sustains 3d10+10 damage and Occupants receive 1d10 damage even if the Endurance roll succeeds, and 2d10 if it fails. |
| 71-80 | Write-Off. As above but the vehicle is reduced to 0 Structure. Occupants sustain same damage as for Severe Roll. |
| 81-90 | Explosion. As above but vehicle's fuel system ignites and explodes within 1d20+10 seconds. If unable to get clear, occupants suffer a further 1d6 burn damage to 1d6 locations |
| 91-98 | Immediate Explosion. As above but the explosion is immediate. |
| 99-00 | Catastrophic Crash. Occupants must successfully roll Endurance or be killed instantly. Damage as for Write-Off is sustained regardless. |

## Shields

Deflector shields provide an additional layer of protection for those vehicles which can mount them. Shields work slightly differently than the Hull, due to their ablative nature. If incoming damage is equal to or less than the value of the shields, then it is all blocked. If damage exceeds the shield value, then any excess reduces the shield strength by that amount.

For example, a troop carrier has an energy shield strength of 12 points. If the carrier was hit by a laser for 11 damage, it simply does not penetrate and has no additional effect. On the other hand, if the carrier was hit by a blast inflicting 15 damage, the excess three points would drop the shield strength to 9.

Once the strength of a deflector shield has dropped to zero, it collapses. Any remaining damage carries onto the hull.

## Weapons

Usually, only military hulls are designed to accommodate weaponry (hard points, ammunition storage, control systems). The 'Weaponised' Trait can be taken for civilian vehicles that may have weapon requirements.

The maximum number of weapon systems a vehicle can support is equal to 1/10th of its Structure Points (so a vehicle with 40 Structure could support 4 weapon systems, if a military vehicle, or a weaponised civilian vehicle).

Weapon systems depend on the Size of the vehicle. The maximum type of weapon system for different Sizes are shown in the tables on page XX.

### Damage

Damage that exceeds the Hull penetrates the vehicle, damaging the Structure and possibly impacting on one or more systems. Depending on the size of the vehicle, damage can be minor or catastrophic.

For example, a Large vehicle may take up to three hits on a system such as its Drive. The fourth hit functionally destroys the Drive. Each time the system takes a hit, it either loses a percentage of its function as described in the Loss per Hit column of the System Damage Table below or a core function (such as Drive, Pilot, Comms, and so on) becomes one Difficulty Grade harder per hit sustained.

**System Damage Table**

| Size | System Hits | Loss per Hit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 1 | 1 Grade or 50% |
| Medium | 2 | 1 Grade or 33% |
| Large | 3 | 1 Grade or 25% |
| Huge | 4 | 1 Grade or 20% |
| Enormous | 5 | 1 Grade or 16% |
| Colossal | 6 | 1 Grade or 10% |

The systems at risk are listed in the Component Damage table below.

**System Component Damage Table**

| 1d10 | System | Damaged Result | Destroyed Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Cargo | An amount of possessions or equipment stored in the hold, proportional to the damage, are destroyed. | All cargo is destroyed. |
| 2 | Comms | Comms rolls suffer one additional Difficulty Grade of difficulty each time they are damaged. | Vehicle can no longer communicate or spoof enemy sensors. |
| 3 | Controls | Boating, Drive, or Pilot rolls suffer one additional Difficulty Grade each time they are damaged; immediate Control roll required. | Vehicle can no longer be steered or change course. |
| 4 | Drive | Speed reduced by an amount proportional to damage. | Vehicle stopped dead; aircraft crash. |
| 5 | Crew | A number of passengers proportional to the damage are rendered casualties. Those affected suffer a Major Wound and must succeed in an Endurance roll or be killed instantly. | Vehicle occupants die. |
| 6 | Engine / Fuel | Maximum Speed is halved; electronic systems one Difficulty Grade more difficult to use. | Vehicle is destroyed in a disastrous explosion. |
| 7 | Sensors | Sensor, Navigation and Weapon attack rolls suffer one additional Difficulty Grade each time they are damaged. | Vehicle is rendered blind. |
| 8 | Weapons | A number of weapon systems proportional to the damage become inoperative. | Vehicle can no longer fire weapons. |
| 9-0 | None | No systems struck; just Structure damage. | N/A |

# Magic and Powers

Games Masters who want to include magic and/or superpowers in their games will find some basic rules for doing so in this section. It is always best to ensure that everyone involved in the game is happy for magic or superpowers to be included, and always give some thought to the kind of game it may produce.

## How Powers Work

Casting a spell or using a superpower usually requires the expenditure of some form of energy drawn from a pool of points. The size of this pool is equal to the character's POW characteristic, and in the case of magicians the pool is known as Magic Points; and for superheroes, Power Points. Using magic or powers costs a certain number of points that is deducted from this pool, and when the pool is empty, no more magic can be cast, or powers used, until it recovers.

Magic recovers at a number of points equal to the character's Healing Rate per hour until they reach a level equal to the character's POW. This assumes that the character is able tocan rest fully, participating in no other activities, , and is not recovering from fatigue or injury. If so, the Games Master can increase the time taken to recover Magic/Power Points, orPoints or reduce the Healing Rate.

For superpowers, Power Points recover at a rate of one per full minute of rest, but characters can also spend a Luck Point to immediately regain 1d4+1 lost Power Points up to their maximum.

### Casting Spells

Spells are cast using the Magic skill ;skill; without it, magic is simply not possible. Preparing and casting a spell requires one Action and a successful Magic roll. If the roll fails, the spell does not work and must be readied and attempted again later. If the roll succeeds, the spell worksworks, and Magic Points are deducted from the Magic Point pool.

### Using Superpowers

Superhero characters find that their superpower is always working, and so needs no roll to use or Power Point expenditure; however, if trying to Boost a power ,power, then there is a Power Point cost.

## Beginning Powers and Learning New Ones

### Magicians

Magicians begin with 1d4+1 spells, all of which are cast using the Magic skill. The player and Games Master should consult on which spells are available and how the character came by them. For example, the character may have been an apprentice to a local magician, ormagician or may have learned magic at their mother's knee.

More spells can be learned, but it costs 3 Experience Rolls to learn a new spell, andspell and takes a week of dedicated study and practice. New spells must be learned from a teacher or a reliable source (such as a scroll or grimoire designed to teach a new spell).

### Superheroes

For superheroes, the Games Master and player should decide how the character came by his or her powers, and what the source of the power is (for example, it may be a suit of special armor, abilities gained through exposure to cosmic rays, or a genetic mutation).

Superheroes start with a number of core powers determined by POW plus another Characteristic based on the source of the powers: CON for altered physiology (mutation, alien species, experimentation) or INT for technology or skill basedskill-based powers (cybernetics, battle suits, intense training, and so on). See the table, below.

A core power can be exchanged for two Boosts that can be applied to any core power. A character may also take up to two Limits from the list starting in the Super Powers section, with one providing a bonus Boost, or two granting a bonus core power. A selection of powers and example Boosts are listed in the Super Powers section.

**Super Powers Table**

| POW+ Characteristic | Core Powers |
| --- | --- |
| 12 or less | 1 |
| 13-20 | 2 |
| 21-30 | 3 |
| 31-40 | 4 |
| 40+ | 5 |

## Magic

Whenever a character wishes to use a spellspell, they make a roll against their Magic skill. Casting takes a single turn, but the amount of Magic Points used and whether the spell is successful depends on the result of the roll..

If the Magic roll is a...

- Critical Success: the spell's Magic Point cost is zero.
- Success: the caster loses 1 Magic Point, and the spell works
- Failure: the caster loses 1 Magic Point, but the spell does not work.
- Fumble: the caster loses 1d3 Magic Points for the spell and the spell fails.

Due to their minor or petty nature, all Magic spells have a default Intensity and Magnitude of 1.

## Limits to Magic Capacity

Characters have no actual limit to the number of Magic spells they can learn, provided that the Games Master permits them to have access to new ones.

## Spells

Spells are defined by various traits defining the effects of the spell and any particular limitationslimitations. Every spell is different with some having fewer traits than others.

### Duration of Spells

Unless a spell has either the Concentration or Instant traits it has a natural duration which lasts the entire scene or action for which the spell was used. A few spells have custom durations noted in the spell's definition.

### Magic Traits

Magic Traits are as follows:

- _**Concentration**_: The spell's effects remain in place as long asif the caster continues to concentrate on maintaining it. Concentration requires the caster to be free of all physical and mental distractions: any such disturbance interrupts the concentration, resulting in the spell's immediate dismissal.
- _**Instant**_: The spell's effects happen immediately. It has no duration.
- _**Ranged**_: Spells with the Ranged trait can be cast at a distance of upup to the character's Magic score in metres. The caster must know the location of the target, such as 'hiding behind the door': if they are unable to directly see or sense the target of the spell, then the Magic roll becomes one grade harder.
- _**Resist (Endurance, Evade, Willpower)**_: Any spell that is not readily accepted by a target can be actively resisted using either Endurance, Evade or Willpower, as determined by this trait. To successfully resist a spell, the target must win an Opposed Roll of the relevant skill against the caster's Magic casting result. If the target fails in the rollroll, then the spell takes effect as normal. Note that resisting is usually a passive action if Endurance or Willpower are the being used. If a spell requires the target to EvadeEvade, then it costs an Action Point to make the Evade attempt. Targets without Action Points to spend in evading will therefore be powerless against the spell's effect.
- _**Touch**_: The caster must be in physical contact with the target whilst the spell is cast. If a target is intent on resisting physical contactcontact, then the caster will most likely fail to complete his spell unless some specific circumstance prevents the target's withdrawal, such as surprise or the Grip special effect. A touch spell merely needs to contact the target or its carried accoutrements in order toto work.

## Spell Descriptions

### Alarm

Special Duration

Casting Alarm on a location such as a room or small clearing creates a temporary psychic bond between the area and the caster. If the area is accessed by a living creature with a SIZ greater than 1, the caster is automatically made aware that something has transgressed no matter how great the distance. The Alarm is usually a distinct tingling sensation or mental twinge which will awaken the caster. Alarm can also be used on an individual object, triggering when touched or moved.

### Avert

Instant, Ranged

Avert is used to dismiss another spell within range. Avert can be cast reactively to neutralise offensive spells, by using the Counter Magic Reactive Action.

### Befuddle

Ranged, Resist (Willpower)

Befuddle causes confusion within the mind of a corporeal target. The subject of the spell has difficulty thinking straight, forgetting where it is, what it is doing and why – often lapsing into disassociated lines of thought. Befuddled targets can still act in self defence, but cannot initiate any constructive activity until the spell ends. Any sort of attack or threatening action instantly breaks the spell, whether or not it was directed specifically at the befuddled target.

### Bladesharp

_**Touch**_

Bladesharp is cast on edged and piercing melee weapons. It increases the damage of a weapon by one dice step and incidentally leaves the edge honed after the spell concludes. This spell is often used on tools such as logging axes, ploughsploughs, and razors. Thus, casting this spell on a dagger increases it to 1d6+1 damage, whereas the same spell on a great axe would increase it to 2d8+2 damage. (1d4→1d6→1d8→1d10→2d6→2d8→2d10).

### Bludgeon

Touch

Bludgeon is similar tolike Bladesharp but used on weapons and tools that deal blunt-force trauma rather than cutting or piercing damage. It is normally used to aid with threshing grain, fulling wool, or similar heavy-duty work.

### Breath

Touch

Breath permits the recipient to hold their breath for an extended period, so that they can temporarily venture into harmful environments, such as underwater; or atmospheres tainted by rock dust, gases, smoke, or poisons. The spell lasts for a maximum of half the caster's POW in minutes, during which time the recipient cannot speak, or the breath is lost, and they immediately begin to asphyxiate (or become poisoned).

### Calm

Ranged, Resist (Willpower)

Calm attempts to dampen down the passions or the target, perhaps ensuring that a lovesick paramour doesn't press his suit, a frightened rival doesn't scream for help or that weapons are not drawn in anger. A calmed person is not otherwise mentally affected; Thus, any sort of assault or threatening action still permits the target to defend themselves and even attack, albeit they will do so in a calm and level-headed manner.

### Chill

Instant, Touch

Chill dramatically reduces the temperature of small objects (no larger than the caster's hand) down to the temperature of ice water. Useful for rapidly cooling hot items, chilling drinks, and so forth. The spell does not freeze an object and neither does it cause any damage to its structure: it merely renders it very cold.

### Darkness

Concentration, Ranged

Darkness creates an area of shadow, equal to POW in square metres, which suppresses all light within it. This is enough volume to fill a modest room, a length of corridor or form a small cloud if cast outside. All non-magical light, including sunlight, passing into or present within the boundary is reduced to the equivalent of a dim glow.

### Disruption

Instant, Ranged, Resist (Endurance)

Disruption is used for damaging or dissembling physical objects without the need for tools. It is commonly employed to drive off or kill living creatures, such as birds or vermin. When successfully cast, Disruption inflicts 1d3 damage to a single random Hit Location or the overall Hit Points of an object. In both cases the damage ignores any armor or natural protection.

### Extinguish

Instant, Ranged

Extinguish immediately quenches flames and small fires of modest size and heat. It is useful for dousing candles, lanterns, torchestorches, or small cook fires, but it will not work on magical or larger, more ferocious conflagrations such as pyres, burning houses or dragon flames.

### Find (X)

Concentration, Ranged, Resist (Special)

Find has many variations; always specific and learned as separate spells. Some common examples are given below. It works by attuning to the natural emanations of a creature or thing, alerting the caster to its presence within the spell's range. Find can be blocked by dense or thick materials such as metal, or earth and stone at least one metre thick. The spell cannot discern emotions or thoughts.

Find Arrows: Locates ammunition shot by hunters, which miss their target.

Find Flaw: Identifies any flaws in an object, such as hidden imperfections or physical damage.

Find Livestock: Locates a particular type of animal. Can be resisted with Willpower.

Find Loot: Locates precious metals and gems.

Find Object: Locates a lost personal possession.

Find Sickness: Identifies the existence of disease and illness, whether magical or mundane.

### Firearrow

Touch

Firearrow causes all missiles thrown or fired by the recipient to burst into flame when released. Ostensibly created to act as a signal flare, it has since evolved into a combat magic. Missiles under its effect add an additional 1d3 damage, butdamage but are extinguished if they impale flesh. Those that strike flammable material have a chance equal to the caster's Folk Magic skill of setting alight whatever they lodge in, such as wooden shields, thatched roofs and so on. Wooden ammunition is consumed as part of the spell.

### Fireblade

Touch

Fireblade is similar tolike Firearrow but is instead cast on hand tools and melee weapons. The original purpose of the spell is to sterilise surgical equipment, aid in slash and burn agriculture or provide illumination during darkness without the need to carry an additional light source. If cast on a weapon it inflicts an additional 1d3 damage, and damage and has the chance of setting flammable materials alight if held to them for several rounds (see Fire in the Game System Section). Wooden hafted weapons under the effects of Fireblade will be consumed as part of the spell.

### Glue

Touch

Glue cements together two solid, inanimate objects for the duration of the spell, for example a cart wheelcartwheel to its axle or a door to its frame. Whilst under the effects of the spell the items, no matter how disparate, cannot be parted unless something actively tries to wrench them apart. In this circumstance the spell has a Brawn skill equal to five times the caster's POW and fails when a superior Brawn is set against it, defeating it in an Opposed Roll. Once the spell concludes or fails, the items part completely unharmed.

### Heal

Instant, Touch

Heal has several different effects depending on the nature of the ailment it is being used on. If the subject is suffering from a minor complaint such as a headache, back pain, hangover, cold, warts and so on, then the symptoms are immediately lifted. Cast on a location suffering a Minor Wound it restores all lost Hit Points instantly. Against Serious or Major Wounds no Hit Points are recovered. HoweverHowever, the spell will stabilise locations, stop all bleeding and prevent imminent death from inattention.

### Ignite

Instant, Ranged

Ignite only works on flammable inorganic matter, causing a small object or hand-sized area to burst into flame. Depending on what was set alight, once burning, the flames may then spread unless quenched or countered in some way. This spell is normally used to light candles, torchestorches, or lanterns from afar. It can also be used to start a camp or cooking fire in adverse conditions, such as using damp kindling or in strong winds.

### Knock

Instant, Touch

Knock magically unfastens any device that is currently secured with a mechanical bar or lock. It does not work on magically locked objects, only mundane ones. The spell only affects a single fastening, so if there are several locks and bars securing the object, the spell will need to be recast for each one.

### Light

Concentration, Ranged

Light must be cast on an inanimate object (this could be a branch, sword blade, spear point, torch and so on). It produces enough light to illuminate an area as though with a lantern. It can also be cast directly against a Darkness spell to counter it. In this case both spells are consumed, leaving the ambient light to illuminate the area.

### Lock

Special Duration, Touch

Lock magically secures any device that already has a mechanical bar or lock present. A Locked device can be opened only by the caster and cannot be picked by mundane means (such as by a thief using lock-picks) since the magic renders the mechanism immobile; howeverhowever, it could still be forced open by breaking the object the lock is set into. The magic remains in place until opened by the caster, after which the device must be subject to a further casting of Lock to restore the enchantment. The Magic Point used to cast Lock does not recover until the spell is dismissed or concludes naturally.

### Phantasm

Concentration, Ranged

Phantasm allows the caster to weave together insubstantial or near weightless objects so that they take a shape or ghostly form. Thus, a spectral figure could be woven from a naturally occurring mist, or a face formed in a pile of dead leaves. Beyond this the spell has little effect, save to frighten, intrigueintrigue, or disconcert those that view it.

### Sleep

Resist (Endurance), Touch

Sleep sends its recipient into a deep, peaceful sleep. It has no effect on creatures with a SIZ greater than the caster's POW. Unless the target resists, it slumbers for a number of hours equal to the half the caster's POW. HoweverHowever, the spell takes 1d3 Rounds to take effect before the target falls unconscious. Any attempt to cast this spell in a combat situation automatically fails.

### Vigour

Touch

Vigour makes the recipient feel alive and energetic, being used to offset the effects of strenuous physical labour. For the spell's duration, all Fatigue effects gained from laborious activity are ignored (but return on the spell's dismissal).

### Witchsight

Ranged, Resist (Willpower)

Witchsight allows the caster to see active magic, enchanted itemsitems, and invisible entities (although such things are simply shadowy representations) that lie within range and line of sight. It can also penetrate illusions or discern the true guise of shapeshifted creatures. Beings which wish to remain hidden or disguised must win an Opposed Roll of their Willpower versus the casting roll.

## Superpowers

The superpowers included here provide a core power that is either always active, oractive or can be activated at will. Core powers can also have special stunts called Boosts that require the expenditure of Power Points to activate. A character that reaches 0 Power Points cannot use Boosts or any core powers with a cost until Power Points are regained.

Limits are optional disadvantages that can be placed on a character, core powers, or Boosts. Each Limit details the circumstances in which it appliesapplies, and the Games Master must approve any Limit chosen.

A character may also take up to two Limits from the list below, with one providing a bonus Boost, or two granting a bonus core power.

## Powers

### Animation

Animate 2 cubic metres of non-living materials within POW in metres to create a construct, usually in a humanoid form. The cost in Power Points is equal to the armor value of the highest value material used, which is also the base armor value of the construct. Constructs have a base STR of 2d6+16 (23), SIZ of 1d6+12 (15), and a DEX of 1d6+8 (11), with Hit Points determined as normal. The character must use actions to direct the construct and it uses the character's skills for any rolls. If the construct takes a Serious Wound to the chest or abdomen, make an opposed Endurance check against the attack roll. If unsuccessful the construct immediately collapses. Example Armor Values/ Power Point Cost: 

| Armor Values | Power Point Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Plastic or Soft Wood | 2 |
| Concrete or Hard Wood | 4 |
| Soft Metal or Stone | 6 |
| Hard Metal | 8 |

_**Boost**_: Spend 2 Power Points to instantly move the construct to another source of the same material within POW in metres.

### Combat Expert

Choose one type of combat expertise from the list below, plus one for every boost spent.

Melee expertise grants one bonus Action Point that can only be used defensively, and effective weapon size is increased by one step for attacks and parries. Ranged expertise reduces the situational modifiers by two grades instead of one when aiming and reload time of ranged weapons is reduced by one.

Boost: Spend 2 Power Points to gain an extra Action Point that can only be used to Attack or Ready Weapon.

### Durability

Hit points are calculated using CON+SIZ+POW and Healing Rate is calculated using CON+ half POW, rounded up.

_**Boost**_: Spend 2 Power Points as a free action to regain Healing Rate in lost Hit Points or a lost level of Fatigue.

### Elemental Control

Choose a specific material or type of energy. Spend an action to control up to half POW in cubic metres of the element anywhere within POW metres. May alter the basic form, orform or create complex shapes with a successful Craft (specific element) check. Upon creation choose either a close combat attack or a ranged attack. The close combat attack has a reach of Very Long and the ranged attack has a range of 8/24/100, then choose any two Combat Effects. Damage and force/size is determined by POW: 8 or less: 1d4/T, 9-12: 1d6/S, 13-15: 1d8/M, 16-18: 1d10/M, 19+: 1d12/L.

_**Boost**_: Spend 3 Power Points to sheathe the character in the element for the scene. Solid materials gain an armor value equal to one fifth POW, rounded up. If it is energy, unarmed attacks inflict extra damage equal to the base damage of the power and unarmed attacks against the character suffer the same damage to the limb used.

### Energy Blast

Fire blasts of a specific type of energy out to a range of 10/30/120 and choose two Combat Effects to apply at time of creation. Damage and force isare determined by the character's POW: 8 or less: 1d6/S, 9-12: 1d8/M, 13-15: 1d10/M, 16-18: 1d12/L, 19+: 2d6/L. To hit, the character rolls against either an applicable Combat Style for the power, orpower or uses Unarmed.

_**Boost**_: Spend 2 Power Points and an action to inflict +1d6 damage on the next energy blast attack.

### Enhanced Reactions

Gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to the critical range of Athletics skill and never end up prone after using Evade.

_**Boost**_: Spend 1 Power Point to make the next Athletics or Acrobatics check one difficulty grade easier.

### Enhanced Speed

Increase base movement by a multiplier based on DEX+POW. Maximum speed outside of combat is equal to ten times the modified movement in kilometres per hour.

DEX+POW: 12 or less: x2, 13-24: x3, 25-36: x4, 37+: x5.

_**Boost**_: Spend 2 Power Points to gain an extra Action Point that can only be used to Change Range, Move, or Outmanoeuvre.

### Enhanced Strength

Damage bonus is calculated using STR+SIZ+POW and maximum lift is determinedetermined by the character's STR+POW: 12 or less: 1 tonne, 13-24: 2 tonnes, 25-36: 3 tonnes, 37+: 5 tonnes. Unarmed attacks count as large size and melee and thrown objects have their size or force increased by one.

_**Boost**_: Spend 3 Power Points to double maximum lift for one action or task.

### Flight

Gain a flight speed equal to POW in metres, with a maximum speed outside of combat equal to ten times movement in kilometres per hour.

_**Boost**_: Spend 3 Power Points during an aerial Move action to initiate a charge attack during the movement.

_**Boost**_: Spend 2 Power Points to use the core power for a different sense.

### Inherent armor

Provides an armor value to all locations equal to one third of CON, rounded up. Characters may choose to reduce the value of a location by up to two points to add it to another location; for exampleexample, lowering the value of their right arm to add to their head.

_**Boost**_: When struck by an attack, gain an extra armor point against it for each 1 Power Point spent.

### Life Support

Gain immunity to two environmental conditions or biological requirements.

_**Boost**_: Gain immunity to two additional environments or requirements.

### Lucky

Calculate base Luck Points with CHA and half of POW, rounded up.

_**Boost**_: Enter a healing trance and spend 1 Power Point per hour to regain one Hit Point to a location with a Major Wound.

### Savant

Choose three skills with one characteristic in common and checks with them are one grade easier.

_**Boost**_: When using a specialised skill such as Craft or Science that is also a Savant skill, spend 3 Power Points to gain a speciality the character doesn't have for one task at the same level as the Savant skill.

### Teleport

Teleport to any visible point within POW in metres as a move action.

_**Boost**_: Spend 2 Power Points to teleport up to half of POW in metres, rounded up, as a free action.

If reduced to 0 Power Points the character returns to a solid state and must make a Hard Endurance check of fall unconscious for 1d6+1 minutes.

_**Boost**_: Spend 3 Power Point to solidify one hit location for one action.

### Limits

#### Activation Cost

The character spends 2 Power Points to activate a core power, orpower or increases ana boost's cost by 2 Power Points. Alternately a continuous power costs 1 Power Point at the start of each turn to maintain.

#### External Power Source

The source of the character's powers is an artefact or device. If small or handheld, the source is vulnerable to Special Effects such as Disarm Weapon or Take Weapon. If it's large, it requires at least one minute to don or activate before the powers can be used.

#### Fatal Flaw

The character must consume or make contact withcontact a substance every four hours or suffer a level of Fatigue. A successful Endurance check can stave this off, but the difficulty of this check increases by one grade for each additional four hours the requirement isn't met.

#### Limited Control

With actions involving the power or boost, the character's range of critical failure increases to 90-00.

#### Limited Power

The power or boost only works under specific conditions or has some reduced effect determined by the Games Master.

#### Physical Limitation

The character has a persistent limiting condition, such as blindness, permanent Hit Point loss to a location, or reduced mobility.

#### Vulnerability

The character takes double damage from a specific form of attack. Alternately the character must make Hard Endurance checks each turn when 5 metres of a specific substance or suffers a level of Fatigue.

# Creatures

This section contains a small sample of creatures and various Creature Abilities. The list of sample creatures is not exhaustive, butexhaustive but provides a good template for developing one's own creatures, orcreatures or adapting them from other sources. All the creatures follow the _Mythras Imperative_ rules outlined and explored in this document; however, in order toto reflect the challenge some creatures (the dragon being a prime example) should pose, the rules have been slightly adjusted to allow for the creature's relative power level.

## Sample Creatures

Use these Sample Creatures as the inspiration for your own creations, adapting the templates as needed for the scenario, level of challenge desired, and so on. The creatures represent typical examples of their species: greater and lesser forms will exist, with higher and lower skills, Combat capabilities, and Hit Points. Note that most of these creatures have certain Abilities. These are fully described on pages XX to XX.

Such weapons increase their damage dice by one step when used against skeletons (for example a club with 1d6 damage would become 1d8). On the other handhand, skeletons are resistant to slashing and thrusting weapons. Reduce the damage dice of slashing weapons by one step, andstep and thrusting weapons by two steps.

## Creature Abilities

A Creature Ability is something it can do naturally as a result ofbecause of its physiology, biology, innate magic, and so forth. Birds, for example, can flap through the air, and so Flying is an ability.

Each of the following Abilities is described in terms of its game effects, and how it may affect interactions with others. Not all these Abilities are on display in the Sample Creatures provided earlier, but they show how seemingly mundane creatures can be turned into something unique, challenging, or downright terrifying. As a general rule of thumbGenerally, creatures should have up to three Abilities that are applicable to their nature and environment. A demonic spider, for example, might have Adhering, Grappler and Vampiric. However, in exceptional cases, more Abilities are allowed to reflect the awesome nature of the creature being described.

#### Adhering

The creature can move freely on vertical surfaces, and even move upside down on a ceiling with no special equipment. Such Movement is always at half the creature's normal Movement rate.

#### Aquatic

The creature breathes water rather than air, generally possessing gills or a skin capable of absorbing dissolved air directly. If taken out of water and their breathing organs allowed to dry out, they begin to suffocate after their CON in minutes if remaining passive or half that time if moving or fighting.

#### Blood Sense

Allows the creature to detect blood over great distances, either carried by wind or water. Traces of blood can be sensed at a distance of upup to 1d6+6 kilometres.

#### Breathe Flame

The creature breathes flame over an area as a Combat Action. The flame covers a cone in front of the creature, which stretches for its CON in metres. At the furthest extent, the width of the cone is one quarter of the creature's CON. Any creature caught in the flame suffers fire-based damage to all hit locations, though a character can attempt to Evade to halve this damage. Armor Points count as normal unless otherwise noted.

A creature can only breathe flame once in a specified time period (usually once per hour or once per day). Further attempts to breathe flame within this time require the creature to pass Endurance rolls with each roll becoming one grade harder, orharder or suffer a level of Fatigue.

#### Burrower

The creature is adept at tunnelling through the ground at its normal Movement rate. Some creatures are limited in the kind of ground they can move through, which is noted in the creature's description.

#### Camouflaged

The creature is adept at hiding due to its colouration or unusual surface texture. Those attempting to spot the creature suffer a penalty to Perception of two difficulty grades.

#### Characteristic Drain

The creature has the innate ability to drain temporary Characteristic points from the target of their attacks. The type of attack, the Characteristic affected, and how to resist the draining effect is detailed in the creature's description.

#### Cold-Blooded

The creature does not need to eat frequently. One meal a week is sufficient to keep it healthy and well fed, and gorging itself on a large amount of meat will remove the need to eat for a month. Conversely, when exposed to temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius, its reflexes become muted, suffering a penalty of –6 to Initiative, and the loss of one Combat Action per round. Below 5 degrees Celsius cold-blooded creatures become completely torpid, entering a helpless catatonic state.

#### Dark Sight

Allows the creature to see normally in the complete absence of light.

#### Death Sense

In tune with the powers of death, the creature can sense the death of living things, and dead flesh at a range of up to half its INT in kilometres.

#### Disease Immunity

The creature is immune to all diseases. All creatures without SIZ automatically have this ability, although it is not specifically listed in their descriptions.

#### Diving Strike

Some creatures can plummet from the sky or surge through the waters to attack their prey, striking with incredible force. This is effectively charging for creatures which are not land based. Diving Strike increases both the Size of the attack, and the creature's Damage Modifier by one step, for this attack only. A diving strike may only be used once per round. The creature must be at least one full round of Movement above its target (or possibly below if submerged) in order toto use the diving strike.

#### Earth Sense

Some creatures are so in tune with the underground world that they can work perfectly well in the total darkness of the deep. By sensing vibration and air pressure, a creature with Earth Sense can fight, and make Perception rolls with no penalty as long asif their target is no more than their INS in metres away. If using Earth Sense above ground the range is halved.

#### Echolocation

The creature senses its environment through reflections of sonic waves. This means that it can perceive others that may be either motionless or hidden. In such circumstances, using a Stealth roll to attempt to remain unperceived by the creature is two grades more difficult.

#### Engulfing

The creature has an orifice which can swallow targets whole. The maximum size of an engulfed victim is figured as half the creature's own SIZ but may be less than this depending on the creature's physiology. When engulfed the victim suffers at least one damage roll based on the creature's bite attack before being swallowed – the time spent chewing depends on the creature, and how sensitive its innards are. If still alive a swallowed victim will begin to suffocate, likely dying by asphyxiation before suffering any noticeable damage from stomach acid. Realistically, an engulfed victim lacks the mobility to move inside the digestive tract or the creature is so large that he will die long before he can cut its way out.

#### Flying

The creature automatically succeeds in everyday moving and manoeuvring whilst flying, andflying and need not roll their Fly skill unless attempting an unusually difficult task, such as flying against a powerful wind, evading a ranged attack in the air, or out-manoeuvringoutmanoeuvring an aerial foe. A flyer may substitute the Fly skill (base STR+DEX) for Evade whilst fighting whilst aloft.

#### Formidable Natural Weapons

This creature is able tocan actively parry or deflect attacks using its natural weapons. This is due to a combination of fighting style and possessing natural armament being formed from resilient substances such as horn, chitin or bone which are able tocan shrug off damage from manufactured weapons. Note that creatures lacking this trait either rely on their natural armor to turn blows or use Evade.

#### Frenzy

When wounded or exposed to a particular substance – blood for instance – the creature must succeed in a Willpower roll or enter a frenzy. The frenzy lasts a number of rounds equal to the creature's CON. During the frenzy they must only spend Combat Actions on attacking or moving towards combat. Spellcasting, parrying, evading, and anything else is forbidden; all thoughts of self-preservation washed away in a red haze. In return, the creature no longer suffers pain or fatigue, and is impervious to mental control. During this timetime, it is immune to all the detrimental effects of Serious Wounds, although a Major Wound will still incapacitate. If still alive, once the frenzy finishes the creature automatically gains a fatigue level of Exhausted.

#### Gaze Attack

The creature has a gaze attack. This attack may be active (the creature must consciously spend an Action Point on its turn to use it on a foe) or passive (anyone looking at the creature is affected), as listed in the creature's description.

#### Grappler

If the creature successfully strikes in combat, it can immediately seize hold of the opponent in addition to inflicting damage. If the creature's attack was parried (or the creature itself is parrying), then the creature is granted the Grip effect against the opponent's limb or the Pin Weapon effect against his weapon instead. The creature always uses its Brawn skill to resist a victim from breaking free.

#### Hold Breath

The creature can hold its breath for extended periods of time. If prepared and remaining fairly static, the creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its CON. This period is halved if the creature is active, such as when swimming or fighting.

#### Immunity

The creature is completely immune to damage caused by one type of source. This source (cold, fire, iron, etc.) will be noted in the creature's listing, but a narrative description may be necessary for some of the more specific immunities.

#### Intimidate

The creature may intimidate opponents as a prelude to combat or to avoid it altogether: growls, snarls, lowering of horns, and so forth. Opponents must make an unopposed Willpower roll to hold their ground; a success allows a character to stand his ground, whereas a failure indicates that they must spend the next round instinctively placing distance between themselves and the creature. If he fumbles the Willpower roll, then the character flees at maximum speed. A critical success allows the character to ignore any further intimidation attempts by the creature or its brethren during that encounter. The effect continues for as long as the creature continues to act in a threatening manner, which includes it making an attack.

#### Leaper

The creature uses Leaping attacks as described in the Combat Section but can combine the leap with a physical attack such as a claw or bite. If the leaping creature wins the opposed leap attack roll, it automatically inflicts damage for one of its natural weapons on the target. This damage cannot be parried except by Passive Blocking.

#### Life Sense

In tune with the rhythms of nature, this creature can determine the vitality of any living creature by touch alone. If the creature makes a successful Perception roll, it learns of the target's current injuries, Fatigue level, and whether it is currently afflicted by any poison or disease. The creature is also aware of any form of life within a number of metres equal to its Willpower skill, which may make Stealth difficult to accomplish.

#### Magic Sense

Similar toLike Life Sense but permits the creature to detect magical emanations over the same distances. If the creature touches another and makes a successful Perception roll, it learns of the target's current magic points, carried enchantments, and active spells.

#### Multi-Headed

The creature gains an additional Combat Action per extra head possessed beyond the first. These are lost as each individual head is incapacitated or severed. Provided one head remains active, the creature can still control its shared body. When a multi-headed creature resists spells which affect emotions or intellect, it rolls individual saves for each still intact head.

#### Multi-Limbed

Similar to Multi-headedmulti-headed, the creature gains an additional Combat Action per extra pair of limbs (beyond the first) it can bring to bear during combat – those normally used to hold up or move the creature do not count. These extra Combat Actions can only be used to perform actions with those specific limbs, andlimbs and are lost as each pair are immobilised or incapacitated.

#### Night Sight

Allows the creature to treat partial darkness as illuminated and darkness as partial darkness.

#### Poison Immunity

The creature is immune to all poisons. All creatures without SIZ automatically have this Trait, although it is not specifically listed in their descriptions.

#### Regeneration

The creature is able tocan regenerate Hit Points lost to damage. The speed of regeneration varies depending upon the creature. Unless specifically noted, regeneration does not replace lost limbs, and the severing of a vital location (head, chestchest, or abdomen) will still result in deathdeath.

#### Swimmer

The creature automatically succeeds in everyday moving and manoeuvring whilst swimming and need not roll their Swim skill unless attempting an unusually difficult task, such as swimming against a powerful tide or leaping up a waterfall. A swimmer may substitute the Swim skill for Athletics and Evade rolls whilst in water.

#### Terrifying

The creature's appearance, form or aura is so terrifying it forces viewers to make an unopposed Willpower roll. Success indicates the viewer is shaken for one round and cannot act offensively. Failure causes them to flee in terror. A fumble causes the viewer to collapse unconscious from the shock. Only a critical success allows the viewer to act unhindered. The viewer need not make any further checks for the remainder of the combat, even if more of the same creatures are present. Repeated exposure to a specific type of Terrifying monster may eventually permit the skill check to become one or more grades easier.

#### Trample

The creature is able tocan trample beings with a SIZ of half or less than its own, using its Athletics skill to attack. This inflicts damage equal to twice the creature's base Damage Modifier and increases the Size of the attack by one step. How, and when trample is used depends on the circumstances. If engaged in combat the creature may trample a prone opponent on its turn, but this costs an Action Point. If the trample is performed whilst the creature is moving or charging over an opponent, then the trample is a Free Action.

#### Undead

Being already dead, the creature is immune to the consequences of both fatigue and severe injuries. Undead are thus immune to all the detrimental effects of Serious Wounds. Even Major Wounds do not incapacitate them, although they can still have locations severed or shattered as per normal. Treat the head or chest location of the undead creature as the area where the spirit or magic has been bound. Any location (and those contiguous to it) which is smashed or severed from the bound area ceases to function, but the remainder of the body can continue if it still has limbs with which to act. A Major Wound to the magic-infused location destroys the undead outright. Only fully corporeal dead creatures may possess the Undead trait.

#### Vampiric

The creature drains its victim's blood, causing an increase in Fatigue levels. The creature must use a bite attack, and cause damage with the bite to be able to drain blood at the rate described in the creature's description.

#### Venomous

The creature has a venomous bite, stingsting, or other means of attack.

#### Wing Buffet

The creature is so large it can damage opponents by beating its wings. This requires an Attack Action and does damage equal to its damage bonus to those within 3 metres of the front or side of the creature.
